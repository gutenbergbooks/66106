<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Pause</span> one moment, gentle
Reader&mdash;only one little moment will I detain you, while I
reply to the question which I have supposed you to ask in the
title-page.&nbsp; Blame not me, I beseech you, if you are
compelled to make the usual accusation against authors, that
there is nothing new in the pages which I diffidently present to
you: I am sorry for it, but I cannot help it.&nbsp; Solomon
asserted that all things under the sun were aged in his time; and
if the wisest of old gentlemen could find nothing new in that
early stage of his empire, what can be expected from a poor
scribbler like me, near three thousand years after him?&nbsp;
Consider too, dear Reader, that this is the first time I have
appeared before you in the character of a story-teller; and that
I am a timid, nervous subject, and very easily discouraged.&nbsp;
Accept me then upon the score of wishing to amuse you, and permit
me to say something for my Tales, after having said so much for
myself.</p>
<p>Of the stories, &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz,&rdquo; as every
body knows, is from the German.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Fortunes of De
la Pole&rdquo; is original; so is &ldquo;The Prediction,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Yellow Dwarf,&rdquo; if I may be allowed that
claim for such a &ldquo;thing of shreds and patches;&rdquo; it is
an <i>olla podrida</i> of odds and ends, a snip of the garment of
every fairy tale written since the days of King Arthur.&nbsp; The
story of &ldquo;The Lord of the Maelstrom&rdquo; is also
original, though, as in that of &ldquo;The Yellow Dwarf,&rdquo; I
have raised my structure upon an old nursery foundation; but it
appeared to me an excellent vehicle for the beautiful mythology
of the North, and the introduction of Odin and his
exploits,&mdash;whose history, by the way, I believe, has been
extracted from the Talmud, or from the rabbinical traditions of
the events previous to the creation, and the deeds of Moses and
others.&nbsp; I, moreover, designed to have given <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>thee a little
poetry for thy money, gentle Reader, but the booksellers shook
their heads when I mentioned my design, and told me it was out of
fashion; so I returned my treasures in that way to my desk, there
to remain, among many other excellent things, I assure thee,
until it should again be the taste in England; and, with two
other short stories, in the meantime offer these Tales of
<i>diablerie</i> for your amusement.&nbsp; Entreat me kindly,
gentle Reader, I beseech you, for two reasons;&mdash;first,
because it will entirely depend upon your reception of this,
whether I shall ever write a second volume&mdash;and secondly,
because there has been a sad sweep lately among those who used to
cater for your diversion: many who were most deserving have been
snatched from your admiration and regard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shelley is
not&mdash;Lord Byron is not&mdash;and Maturin have they taken
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; For myself, I am not a long-lived man, and
therefore advise you to make much of me while I am with you; and
as an example, look upon these &ldquo;<i>coglionerie</i>&rdquo;
with a milder eye than their merits may seem to deserve from your
judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, dear Reader, truly yours,</p>

PREDICTION.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk
of Graves.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the south-west coast of the
principality of Wales stands a romantic little village, inhabited
chiefly by the poorer class of people, consisting of small
farmers and oyster dredgers, whose estates are the wide ocean,
and whose ploughs are the small craft, in which they glide over
its interminable fields in search of the treasures which they
wring from its bosom; it is built on the very top of a hill,
commanding on the one side an immense bay, and on the other, of
the peaceful green fields and valleys, cultivated by the greater
part of its quiet inhabitants.&nbsp; The approach to it from the
nearest town was by a road, which branched away into lanes and
wooded walks, and from the sea by a beautiful little bay, running
up far into the land; both sides of which and indeed all the rest
of the coast were guarded by craggy and gigantic rocks, some of
them hollowing into caverns, into which none of the inhabitants,
from motives of superstition, reverence, and fear, had ever dared
to penetrate.&nbsp; There were, at the period of which we are
about to treat, no better sort of inhabitants in the little
village just described, <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>none of those so emphatically
distinguished as &ldquo;quality&rdquo; by the country people;
they had neither parson, lawyer, nor doctor, among them, and of
course there was a tolerable equality among the residents.&nbsp;
The farmer, who followed his own plough in the spring, singing
the sweet wild national chaunt of the season, and bound up with
his own hands his sheaves in autumn, was not richer, greater, nor
finer, than he who, bare-legged on the strand, gathered in the
hoar weeds for the farmer in the spring, or dared the wild winds
of autumn and the wrath of the winter in his little boat, to earn
with his dredging net a yet harder subsistence for his
family.&nbsp; Distinctions were unknown in the village, every man
was the equal of his neighbour.</p>
<p>But, though rank and its polished distinctions were strange in
the village of N&mdash;, the superiority of talent was felt and
acknowledged almost without a pause or a murmur.&nbsp; There was
one who was as a king amongst them, by the mere force of a
mightier spirit than those with whom he sojourned had been
accustomed to feel among them: he was a dark and moody man, a
stranger, evidently of a higher order than those around him, who
had a few months before settled among them: he was poor, but had
no occupation&mdash;he lived frugally, but quite alone&mdash;and
his sole occupation was to read during the day, and wander out
unaccompanied into the fields or by the beach during the
night.&nbsp; Sometimes indeed he would relieve a suffering child
or rheumatic old man by medicinal herbs, reprove idleness and
drunkenness in the youth, and predict to all the good and evil
consequences of their conduct; and his success in some cases, his
foresight in others, and his wisdom in all, won for him a high
reputation among the cottagers, to which his taciturn habits
contributed not a little, for, with the vulgar as with <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the educated,
no talker was ever seriously taken for a conjuror, though a
silent man is often decided to be a wise one.</p>
<p>There was but one person in N&mdash; at all disposed to rebel
against the despotic sovereignty which Rhys Meredith was silently
establishing over the quiet village, and that was precisely the
person most likely to effect a revolution; she was a beautiful
maiden, the glory and boast of the village, who had been the
favourite of, and to a certain degree educated by, the late lady
of the lord of the manor; but she had died, and her pupil, with a
full consciousness of her intellectual superiority, had returned
to her native village, where she determined to have an empire of
her own, which no rival should dispute: she laughed at the
maidens who listened to the predictions of Rhys, and she refused
her smiles to the youths who consulted him upon their affairs and
their prospects; and as the beautiful Ruth was generally beloved,
the silent Rhys was soon in danger of being abandoned by all,
save doting men and paralytic women, and feeling himself an
outcast in the village of N&mdash;.</p>
<p>But to be such was not the object of Meredith; he was an idle
man, and the gifts of the villagers contributed to spare him from
exertion; he knew too, that in another point of view his
ascendancy was necessary to his purposes; and as he had failed to
establish it by wisdom and benevolence, he determined to try the
effect of fear.&nbsp; The character of the people with whom he
sojourned was admirably calculated to assist his projects; his
predictions were now uttered more clearly, and his threats
denounced in sterner tones and stronger and plainer words; and
when he predicted that old Morgan Williams, who had been stricken
with the palsy, would die at the turn of tide, three days from
that on which he <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>spoke, and that the light little boat of gay Griffy
Morris, which sailed from the bay in a bright winter&rsquo;s
morning, should never again make the shore; and the man died, and
the storm arose, even as he had said; men&rsquo;s hearts died
within them, and they bowed down before his words, as if he had
been their general fate and the individual destiny of each.</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s rosy lip grew pale for a moment as she heard of
these things; in the next her spirit returned, and &ldquo;I will
make him tell my fortune,&rdquo; she said, as she went with a
party of laughers to search out and deride the conjuror.&nbsp; He
was alone when they broke in upon him, and their mockeries goaded
his spirit; but his anger was deep, not loud; and while burning
with wrath, he yet could calmly consider the means of vengeance:
he knew the master spirit with which he had to contend; it was no
ordinary mind, and would have smiled at ordinary terrors.&nbsp;
To have threatened her with sickness, misfortune, or death, would
have been to call forth the energies of that lofty spirit, and
prepare it to endure, and it would have gloried in manifesting
its powers of endurance; he must humble it therefore by
debasement; he must ruin its confidence in itself; and to this
end he resolved to threaten her with crime.&nbsp; His resolution
was taken and effected; his credit was at stake; he must daunt
his enemy, or surrender to her power: he foretold sorrows and
joys to the listening throng, not according to his passion, but
his judgment, and he drew a blush upon the cheek of one, by
revealing a secret which Ruth herself, and another, alone knew,
and which prepared the former to doubt of her own judgment, as it
related to this extraordinary man.</p>
<p>Ruth was the last who approached to hear the secret of her
destiny.&nbsp; The wizard paused as he <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>looked upon her,&mdash;opened his
book,&mdash;shut it,&mdash;paused,&mdash;and again looked sadly
and fearfully upon her; she tried to smile, but felt startled,
she knew not why; the bright inquiring glance of her dark eye
could not change her enemy.&nbsp; Her smile could not melt, nor
even temper, the hardness of his deep-seated malice: he again
looked sternly upon her brow, and then coldly wrung out the slow
soul-withering words, &ldquo;Maiden, thou art doomed to be a
murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that hour Rhys Meredith became the destiny of Ruth
Tudor.&nbsp; At first she spurned at his prediction, and
alternately cursed and laughed at him for the malice of his
falsehood: but when she found that none laughed with her, that
men looked upon her with suspicious eyes, women shrunk from her
society, and children shrieked at her presence, she felt that
these were signs of truth, and her high spirit no longer
struggled against the conviction; a change came over her mind
when she had known how horrid it was to be alone.&nbsp; Abhorring
the prophet, she yet clung to his footsteps, and while she sat by
his side, felt as if he alone could avert that evil destiny which
he alone had foreseen.&nbsp; With him only was she seen to smile;
elsewhere, sad, silent, stern; it seemed as if she were ever
occupied in nerving her mind for that which she had to do, and
her beauty, already of the majestic cast, grew absolutely awful,
as her perfect features assumed an expression which might have
belonged to the angel of vengeance or death.</p>
<p>But there were moments when her naturally strong spirit, not
yet wholly subdued, struggled against her conviction, and
endeavoured to find modes of averting her fate: it was in one of
these, perhaps, that she gave her hand to a wooer, from a distant
part of the country, a sailor, who either had <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>not heard, or
did not regard the prediction of Rhys, upon condition that he
should remove her far from her native village to the home of his
family and friends, for she sometimes felt as if the decree which
had gone forth against her, could not be fulfilled except upon
the spot where she had heard it, and that her heart would be
lighter if men&rsquo;s eyes would again look upon her in
kindliness, and she no longer sate beneath the glare of those
that knew so well the secret of her soul.&nbsp; Thus thinking,
she quitted N&mdash; with her husband; and the tormentor, who had
poisoned her repose, soon after her departure, left the village
as secretly and as suddenly as he had entered it.</p>
<p>But, though Ruth could depart from his corporeal presence, and
look upon his cruel visage no more, yet the eye of her soul was
fixed upon his shadow, and his airy form, the creation of her
sorrow, still sat by her side; the blight that he had breathed
upon her peace had withered her heart, and it was in vain that
she sought to forget or banish the recollection from her
brain.&nbsp; Men and women smiled upon her as before in the days
of her joy, the friends of her husband welcomed her to their
bosoms, but they could give no peace to her heart: she shrunk
from their friendship, she shivered equally at their neglect, she
dreaded any cause that might lead to that which, it had been
said, she must do; nightly she sat alone and thought, she dwelt
upon the characters of those around her, and shuddered that in
some she saw violence and selfishness enough to cause injury,
which she might be supposed to resent to blood.&nbsp; Then she
wept bitter tears and thought of her native village, whose
inhabitants were so mild, and whose previous knowledge of her
hapless destiny might induce them to avoid all that might hasten
its completion, and sighed to think she had <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>ever left it
in the mistaken hope of finding peace elsewhere.&nbsp; Again, her
sick fancy would ponder upon the modes of murder, and wonder how
her victim would fall.&nbsp; Against the use of actual violence
she had disabled herself; she had never struck a blow, her small
hand would suffer injury in the attempt; she understood not the
usage of fire-arms, she was ignorant of what were poisons, and a
knife she never allowed herself, even for the most necessary
purposes: how then could she slay?&nbsp; At times she took
comfort from thoughts like these, and at others, in the blackness
of her despair, she would cry, &ldquo;If it must be, O let it
come, and these miserable anticipations cease; then I shall, at
least, destroy but one; now, in my incertitude, I am the murderer
of many!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband went forth and returned upon the voyages which
made up the avocation and felicity of his life, without noticing
the deep-rooted sorrow of his wife: he was a common man, and of a
common mind; his eye had not seen the awful beauty of her whom he
had chosen; his spirit had not felt her power; and, if he had
marked, he would not have understood her grief; so she ministered
to him as a duty.&nbsp; She was a silent and obedient wife, but
she saw him come home without joy, and witnessed his departure
without regret; he neither added to nor diminished her sorrow:
but destiny had one solitary blessing in store for the victim of
its decrees,&mdash;a child was born to the hapless Ruth, a lovely
little girl soon slept upon her bosom, and, coming as it did, the
one lone and lovely rose-bud in her desolate garden, she welcomed
it with a warmer joy and cherished it with a kindlier hope.</p>
<p>A few years went by unsoiled by the wretchedness which had
marked the preceding; the joy of <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the mother softened the anguish of
the condemned, and sometimes when she looked upon her daughter
she ceased to despair: but destiny had not forgotten her claim,
and soon her hand pressed heavily upon her victim; the giant
ocean rolled over the body of her husband, poverty visited the
cottage of the widow, and famine&rsquo;s gaunt figure was visible
in the distance.&nbsp; Oppression came with these, for arrears of
rent were demanded, and he who asked was brutal in his anger and
harsh in his language to the sufferers.&nbsp; Ruth shuddered as
she heard him speak, and trembled for him and for herself; the
unforgotten prophecy arose in her mind, and she preferred even
witnesses to his brutality and her degradation, rather than
encounter his anger and her own dark thoughts alone.</p>
<p>Thus goaded, she saw but one thing that could save her, she
fled from her persecutors to the home of her youth, and, leading
her little Rachel by the hand, threw herself into the arms of her
kin: they received her with distant kindness, and assured her
that she should not want; in this they kept their promise, but it
was all they did for Ruth and her daughter; a miserable
subsistence was given to them, and that was embittered by
distrust, and the knowledge that it was yielded unwillingly.</p>
<p>Among the villagers, although she was no longer shunned as
formerly, her story was not forgotten; if it had been, her
terrific beauty, the awful flashing of her eyes, her large black
curls hanging like thunder-clouds over her stern and stately brow
and marble throat, her majestic stature, and solemn movements,
would have recalled it to their recollections.&nbsp; She was a
marked being, and all believed (though each would have pitied her
had <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>they
not been afraid) that her evil destiny was not to be averted; she
looked like one fated to some wonderful deed.&nbsp; They saw she
was not one of them, and though they did not directly avoid her,
yet they never threw themselves into her way, and thus the
hapless Ruth had ample leisure to contemplate and grieve over her
fate.&nbsp; One night she sat alone in her wretched hovel, and,
with many bitter ruminations, was watching the happy sleep of her
child, who slumbered tranquilly on their only bed: midnight had
long passed, yet Ruth was not disposed to rest; she trimmed her
dull light, and said mentally, &ldquo;Were I not poor, such a
temptation might not assail me, riches would procure me
deference; but poverty, or the wrongs it brings, may drive me to
this evil; were I above want it would be less likely to be.&nbsp;
O, my child, for thy sake would I avoid this doom more than for
mine own, for if it should bring death to me, what will it not
hurl on thee?&mdash;infamy, agony, scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wept aloud as she spoke, and scarcely seemed to notice the
singularity (at that late hour) of some one without, attempting
to open the door; she heard, but the circumstance made little
impression; she knew that as yet her doom was unfulfilled, and
that, therefore, no danger could reach her; she was no coward at
any time, but now despair had made her brave; the door opened and
a stranger entered, without either alarming or disturbing her,
and it was not till he had stood face to face with Ruth, and
discovered his features to be those of Rhys Meredith, that she
sprung up from her seat and gazed wildly and earnestly upon
him.</p>
<p>Meredith gave her no time to question; &ldquo;Ruth <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Tudor,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;behold the cruelest of thy foes comes sueing to
thy pity and mercy; I have embittered thy existence, and doomed
thee to a terrible lot; what first was dictated by vengeance and
malice became truth as I uttered it, for what I spoke I
believed.&nbsp; Yet, take comfort, some of my predictions have
failed, and why may not this be false?&nbsp; In my own fate I
have ever been deceived, perhaps I may be equally so in thine; in
the mean time have pity upon him who was thy enemy, but who, when
his vengeance was uttered, instantly became thy friend.&nbsp; I
was poor, and thy scorn might have robbed me of subsistence in
danger, and thy contempt might have given me up.&nbsp; Beggared
by many disastrous events, hunted by creditors, I fled from my
wife and son because I could no longer bear to contemplate their
suffering; I sought fortune all ways since we parted, and always
has she eluded my grasp till last night, when she rather tempted
than smiled upon me.&nbsp; At an idle fair I met the steward of
this estate drunk and stupid, but loaded with gold; he travelled
towards home alone; I could not, did not wrestle with the fiend
that possessed me, but hastened to overtake him in his lonely
ride.&mdash;Start not! no hair of his head was harmed by me; of
his gold I robbed him, but not of his life, had I been the
greater villain, I should now be in less danger, since he saw and
marked my person: three hundred pounds is the meed of my daring,
and I must keep it now or die.&nbsp; Ruth, thou too art poor and
forsaken, but thou art faithful and kind, and will not betray me
to justice; save me, and I will not enjoy my riches alone; thou
knowest all the caves in the rocks, those hideous hiding-places,
where no foot, save thine, has dared <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to tread; conceal me in these till
the pursuit be past, and I will give thee one half my wealth, and
return with the other to gladden my wife and son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand of Ruth was already opened, and in imagination she
grasped the wealth he promised; oppression and poverty had
somewhat clouded the nobleness but not the fierceness of her
spirit.&nbsp; She saw that riches would save her from wrath,
perhaps from blood, and, as the means to escape so mighty an
evil, she was not scrupulous respecting a lesser: independently
of this, she felt a great interest in the safety of Rhys; her own
fate seemed to hang upon his; she hid the ruffian in the caves
and supplied him with light and food.</p>
<p>There was a happiness now in the heart of Ruth&mdash;a joy in
her thoughts as she sat all the long day upon the deserted settle
of her wretched fireside, to which they had for many years been
strangers.&nbsp; Many times during the past years of her sorrow
she had thought of Rhys, and longed to look upon his face and sit
beneath his shadow, as one whose presence could preserve her from
the evil fate which he himself had predicted.&nbsp; She had long
since forgiven him his prophecy; she believed he had spoken the
truth, and this gave her a wild confidence in his power; a
confidence that sometimes thought, &ldquo;if he can foreknow, can
he not also avert?&rdquo;&nbsp; She said mentally, without any
reference to the temporal good he had promised her, &ldquo;I have
a treasure in those caves; <i>he</i> is there; he who hath
foreseen and may oppose my destiny; he hath shadowed my days with
sorrow, and forbidden me, like ordinary beings, to hope: yet he
is now in my power; his life is in my hands; he says so, yet I
believe him not, for I cannot betray <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>him if I would; were I to lead the
officers of justice to the spot where he lies crouching, he would
be invisible to their sight or to mine; or I should become
speechless ere I could say, &lsquo;Behold him.&rsquo;&nbsp; No,
he cannot die by me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she thought she would deserve his confidence, and support
him in his suffering; she had concealed him in a deep dark cave,
hewn far in the rock, to which she alone knew the entrance from
the beach; there was another (if a huge aperture in the top of
the rock might be so called), which, far from attempting to
descend, the peasants and seekers for the culprit had scarcely
dared to look into, so perpendicular, dark, and uncertain was the
hideous descent into what justly appeared to them a bottomless
abyss; they passed over his head in their search through the
fields above, and before the mouth of his den upon the beach
below, yet they left him in safety, though in incertitude and
fear.</p>
<p>It was less wonderful, the suspicionless conduct of the
villagers towards Ruth, than the calm prudence with which she
conducted all the details relating to her secret; her poverty was
well known, yet she daily procured a double portion of food,
which was won by double labour; she toiled in the fields for the
meed of oaten cake and potatoes, or she dashed out in a crazy
boat on the wide ocean to win with the dredgers the spoils of the
oyster beds that lie on its bosom; the daintier fare was for the
unhappy guest, and daily did she wander among the rocks, when the
tides were retiring, for the shell-fish which they had flung
among the fissures in their retreat, which she bore, exhausted
with fatigue, to her home&mdash;and which her lovely child, now
rising into womanhood, <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>prepared for the luxurious meal; it
was wonderful too, the settled prudence of the little maiden, who
spoke nothing of the food which was borne from their frugal
board; if she suspected the secret of her mother, she respected
it too much to allow others to discover that she did so.</p>
<p>Many sad hours did Ruth pass in the robber&rsquo;s cave; and
many times, by conversing with him upon the subject of her
destiny, did she seek to alleviate the pangs its recollection
gave her; but the result of such discussions were by no means
favourable to her hopes; Rhys had acknowledged that his threat
had originated in malice, and that he intended to alarm and
subdue, but not to the extent that he had effected: &ldquo;I knew
well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that disgrace alone would operate
upon you as I wished, for I foresaw you would glory in the
thought of nobly sustained misfortune; I meant to degrade you
with the lowest; I meant to attribute to you what I now painfully
experience to be the vilest of the vices; I intended to tell you,
you were destined to be a thief, but I could not utter the words
I had arranged and I was struck with horror at those I heard
involuntarily proceeding from my lips; I would have recalled them
but I could not; I would have said, &lsquo;Maiden, I did but
jest,&rsquo; but there was something that seemed to withhold my
speech and press upon my soul, &lsquo;so as thou hast said shall
this thing be&rsquo;&mdash;yet take comfort, my own fortunes have
ever deceived me, and doubtlessly ever will, for I feel as if I
should one day return to this cave and make it my final
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke solemnly and wept,&mdash;but the awful eye of his
companion was unmoved as she looked on in wonder and contempt at
his grief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>knowest not how to endure,&rdquo;
said she to him, &ldquo;and as soon as night shall again fall
upon our mountains, I will lead thee forth on thy escape; the
danger of pursuit is now past; at midnight be ready for thy
journey, leave the cave, and ascend the rocks by the path I
shewed thee, to the field in which its mouth is situated; wait me
there a few moments, and I will bring thee a fleet horse, ready
saddled for the journey, for which thy gold must pay, since I
must declare to the owner that I have sold it at a distance, and
for more than its rated value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That midnight came, and Meredith waited with trembling anxiety
for the haughty step of Ruth; at length he saw her, she had
ascended the rock, and standing on its verge, was looking around
for her guest; as she was thus alone in the clear moonlight,
standing between rock and sky, and scarcely seemed to touch the
earth, her dark locks and loose garments scattered by the wind,
she looked like some giant spirit of the olden time, preparing to
ascend into the mighty black cloud which singly hung from the
empyreum, and upon which she already appeared to recline;
Meredith beheld her and shuddered,&mdash;but she approached and
he recovered his recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be speedy in your movements,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;when you leave me; your horse waits on the other side of
this field, and I would have you hasten lest his neighings should
betray your purpose.&nbsp; But, before you depart, Rhys Meredith,
there is an account to be settled between us: I have dared danger
and privations for you; that the temptations of the poor may not
assail me, give me my reward and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Rhys
pressed his leathern bag to his bosom, but answered nothing to
the speech of Ruth: he seemed to be studying some evasion, for he
looked upon the ground, and there was trouble in the working of
his lip.&nbsp; At length he said cautiously, &ldquo;I have it not
with me: I buried it, lest it should betray me, in a field some
miles distant; thither will I go, dig it up, and send it to thee
from B&mdash;, which is, as thou knowest, my first
destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth gave him one glance of her awful eye when he had spoken;
she had detected his meanness, and smiled at his incapacity to
deceive.&nbsp; &ldquo;What dost thou press to thy bosom so
earnestly?&rdquo; she demanded; &ldquo;surely thou art not the
wise man I deemed thee, thus to defraud <i>my</i> claim: the
friend alone thou mightest cheat, and safely; but I have been
made wretched by thee, guilty by thee, and thy life is in my
power; I could, as thou knowest, easily raise the village, and
win half thy wealth by giving thee up to justice; but I prefer
reward from thy wisdom and gratitude; give, therefore, and be
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rhys knew too well the value of the metal of sin to yield
one half of it to Ruth; he tried many miserable shifts and lies,
and at last, baffled by the calm penetration of his antagonist,
boldly avowed his intention of keeping all the spoil he had won
with so much hazard.&nbsp; Ruth looked at him with scorn:
&ldquo;Keep thy gold,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if it thus can
harden hearts, I covet not its possession; but there is one thing
thou must do, and that ere thou stir one foot.&nbsp; I have
supported thee with hard-earned industry, <i>that</i> I give
thee; more proud, it should seem, in bestowing than I could be,
from such as thee, in receiving: but the <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>horse that is
to bear thee hence to-night I borrowed for a distant journey; I
must return with it, or with its value; open thy bag, pay me for
that, and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rhys seemed afraid to open his bag in the presence of her
he had wronged.&nbsp; Ruth understood his fears; but, scorning
vindication of <i>her</i> principles, contented herself with
entreating him to be honest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be more just to thyself
and me,&rdquo; she persisted: &ldquo;the debt of gratitude I
pardon thee; but, I beseech thee, leave me not to encounter the
consequence of having stolen from my friend the animal which is
his only means of subsistence: I pray thee, Rhys, not to condemn
me to scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to no avail that Ruth humbled herself to entreaties;
Meredith answered not, and while she was yet speaking, cast
side-long looks towards the gate where the horse was waiting for
his service, and seemed meditating, whether he should not dart
from Ruth, and escape her entreaties and demands by dint of
speed.&nbsp; Her stern eye detected his purpose; and, indignant
at his baseness, and ashamed of her own degradation, she sprung
suddenly towards him, made a desperate clutch at the leathern
bag, and tore it from the grasp of the deceiver.&nbsp; Meredith
made an attempt to recover it, and a fierce struggle ensued,
which drove them both back towards the yawning mouth of the cave
from which he had just ascended to the world.&nbsp; On its very
verge, on its very extreme edge, the demon who had so long ruled
his spirit now instigated him to mischief, and abandoned him to
his natural brutality: he struck the unhappy Ruth a revengeful
and tremendous blow.&nbsp; At that moment a horrible thought
glanced like <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>lightning through her soul; he was to her no longer what
he had been; he was a robber, ruffian, liar; one whom to destroy
was justice, and perhaps it was he&mdash;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;thou&mdash;thou didst
predict that I was doomed to be a murderer! art thou&mdash;art
thou destined to be the victim?&rdquo;&nbsp; She flung him from
her with terrific force, as she stood close to the abyss, and the
next instant heard him dash against its sides, as he was whirled
headlong into darkness.</p>
<p>It was an awful feeling, the next that passed over the soul of
Ruth Tudor, as she stood alone in the pale sorrowful-looking
moonlight, endeavouring to remember what had chanced.&nbsp; She
gazed on the purse, on the chasm, wiped the drops of agony from
her heated brow, and then, with a sudden pang of recollection,
rushed down to the cavern.&nbsp; The light was still burning, as
Rhys had left it, and served to shew her the wretch extended
helplessly beneath the chasm.&nbsp; Though his body was crushed,
his bones splintered, and his blood was on the cavern&rsquo;s
sides, he was yet living, and raised his head to look upon her,
as she darkened the narrow entrance in her passage: he glared
upon her with the visage of a demon, and spoke like a fiend in
pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me hast thou murdered!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I shall be avenged in all thy life to come.&nbsp; Deem
not that thy doom is fulfilled, that the deed to which thou art
fated is done: in my dying hour I know, I feel what is to come
upon thee; thou art yet again to do a deed of blood!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; shrieked the infuriated victim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou art yet doomed to be a murderer!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art&mdash;and
of&mdash;thine only child!&rdquo;&nbsp; She rushed to him, but he
was dead.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Ruth
Tudor stood for a moment by the corpse, blind, stupefied, deaf,
and dumb; in the next she laughed aloud, till the cavern rung
with her ghastly mirth, and many voices mingled with and answered
it; but the noises scared and displeased her, and in an instant
she became stupidly grave; she threw back her dark locks with an
air of offended dignity, and walked forth majestically from the
cave.&nbsp; She took the horse by his rein, and led him back to
his stable: with the same unvarying calmness she entered her
cottage, and listened to the quiet breathings of her sleeping
child; she longed to approach her nearer, but some new and horrid
fear restrained her, and held back her anxious step: suddenly
remembrance and reason returned, and she uttered a shriek so full
of agony, so loud and shrill, that her daughter sprung from her
bed, and threw herself into her arms.</p>
<p>It was in vain that the gentle Rachel supplicated her mother
to find rest in sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; she
muttered, &ldquo;it must not be here; the deep cave and the hard
rock, these shall be my resting place; and the bed-fellow, lo!
now, he waits my coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she would cry aloud,
clasp her Rachel to her beating heart, and as suddenly, in horror
thrust her from it.</p>
<p>The next midnight beheld Ruth Tudor in the cave seated upon a
point of rock, at the head of the corpse, her chin resting upon
her hands, gazing earnestly upon the distorted face.&nbsp; Decay
had already begun its work; and Ruth sat there watching the
progress of mortality, as if she intended that her stern eye
should quicken and facilitate its operation.&nbsp; The next night
also beheld her there, but the current of her thoughts had
changed, and <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>the dismal interval which had passed appeared to be
forgotten.&nbsp; She stood with her basket of food: &ldquo;Wilt
thou not eat?&rdquo; she demanded; &ldquo;arise, strengthen thee
for thy journey; eat, eat, thou sleeper; wilt thou never awaken?
look, here is the meat thou lovest;&rdquo; and as she raised his
head, and put the food to his lips, the frail remnant of
mortality shattered at her touch, and again she knew that he was
dead.</p>
<p>It was evident to all that a shadow and a change was over the
senses of Ruth; till this period she had been only wretched, but
now madness was mingled with her grief.&nbsp; It was in no
instance more apparent than in her conduct towards her beloved
child: indulgent to all her wishes, ministering to all her wants
with a liberal hand, till men wondered from whence she derived
the means of indulgence, she yet seized every opportunity to send
her from her presence.&nbsp; The gentle-hearted Rachel wept at
her conduct, yet did not complain, for she believed it the effect
of the disease, that had for so many years been preying upon her
soul.&nbsp; Her nights were passed in roaming abroad, her days in
the solitude of her hut; and even this became painful, when the
step of her child broke upon it.&nbsp; At length she signified
that a relative of her husband had died and left her wealth, and
that it should enable her to dispose of herself as she had long
wished; so leaving Rachel with her relatives in N&mdash;, she
retired to a hut upon a lonely heath, where she was less
wretched, because abandoned to her wretchedness.</p>
<p>In many of her ravings she had frequently spoken darkly of her
crime, and her nightly visits to the cave; and more frequently
still she addressed some unseen thing, which she asserted <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>was for ever
at her side.&nbsp; But few heard these horrors, and those who
did, called to mind the early prophecy, and deemed them the
workings of insanity in a fierce and imaginative mind.&nbsp; So
thought also the beloved Rachel, who hastened daily to embrace
her mother, but not now alone as formerly; a youth of the village
was her companion and protector, one who had offered her worth
and love, and whose gentle offers were not rejected.&nbsp; Ruth,
with a hurried gladness, gave her consent, and a blessing to her
child; and it was remarked that she received her daughter more
kindly, and detained her longer at the cottage, when Evan was by
her side, than when she went to the gloomy heath alone.&nbsp;
Rachel herself soon made this observation, and as she could
depend upon the honesty and prudence of him she loved, she felt
less fear at his being a frequent witness of her mother&rsquo;s
terrific ravings.&nbsp; Thus all that human consolation was
capable to afford was offered to the sufferer by her sympathising
children.</p>
<p>But the delirium of Ruth Tudor appeared to increase with every
nightly visit to the cave of secret blood; some hideous shadow
seemed to follow her steps in the darkness, and sit by her side
in the light.&nbsp; Sometimes she held strange parley with this
creation of her phrensy, and at others smiled upon it in scornful
silence; now, her language was in the tones of entreaty, pity,
and forgiveness; anon, it was the burst of execration, curses,
and scorn.&nbsp; To the gentle listeners her words were
blasphemy; and, shuddering at her boldness, they deemed, in the
simple holiness of their own hearts, that the evil one was
besetting her, and that religion alone could banish him.&nbsp;
Possessed by this idea, Evan one day suddenly <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>interrupted
her tremendous denunciations upon her fate, and him who, she
said, stood over her to fulfil it, with imploring her to open the
book which he held in his hand, and seek consolation from its
words and promises.&nbsp; She listened, and grew calm in a
moment; with an awful smile she bade him open, and read at the
first place which should meet his eye: &ldquo;from that, the word
of truth, as thou sayest, I shall know my fate; what is there
written I will believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He opened the book, and
read&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whither shall I go from thy spirit</i>, <i>or
whither shall I flee from thy presence</i>?&nbsp; <i>If I go up
into heaven</i>, <i>thou art there</i>; <i>if I make my bed in
hell</i>, <i>thou art there</i>; <i>If I take the wings of the
morning</i>, <i>and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea</i>,
<i>even there shall thy hand lead me</i>, <i>and thy right hand
shall hold me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth laid her hand upon the book: &ldquo;it is enough; its
words are truth; it hath said there is no hope, and I find
comfort in my despair: I have already spoken thus in the secrecy
of my heart, and I know that he will be obeyed; the unnamed sin
must be&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evan knew not how to comfort, so he
shut up his book and retired; and Rachel kissed the cheek of her
mother, as she bade her a tender good night.&nbsp; Another month
and she was to be the bride of Evan, and she passed over the
heath with a light step, for the thought of her bridal seemed to
give joy to her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall all be happy
then,&rdquo; said the smiling girl, as the youth of her heart
parted from her hand for the night; &ldquo;and heaven kindly
grant that happiness may last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time appointed for the marriage of Rachel <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Tudor and
Evan Edwards had long passed away, and winter had set in with
unusual sternness even on that stormy coast; when, during a land
tempest, on a dark November afternoon, a stranger to the country,
journeying on foot, lost his way in endeavouring to find a short
route to his destination, over stubble fields and meadow lands,
by following the footmarks of those who had preceded him.&nbsp;
The stranger was a young man, of a bright eye and hardy look, and
he went on buffeting the elements, and buffeted by them, without
a thought of weariness, or a single expression of
impatience.&nbsp; Night descended upon him as he walked, and the
snow storm came down with unusual violence, as if to try the
temper of his mind, a mind cultivated and enlightened, though
cased in a frame accustomed to hardships, and veiled by a plain,
nay almost rustic exterior.&nbsp; The thunder roared loudly above
him, and the wind blowing tremendously, raised the new-fallen
snow from the earth, which, mingling with the showers as they
fell, raised a clatter about his head which bewildered and
blinded the traveller, who, finding himself near some leafless
brambles and a few clustered bushes of the mountain broom, took
shelter under them to recover his senses, and reconnoitre his
position.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of all these ingredients for a
storm,&rdquo; said he smilingly to himself, &ldquo;the lightning
is the most endurable after all; for if it does not kill, it may
at least cure, by lighting the way out of a labyrinth, and by its
bright flashes I hope to discover where I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
this hope he was not mistaken: the brilliant and beautiful gleam
showed him, when the snow shower had somewhat abated, every
stunted bush and blade of grass for some miles, and something, <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>about the
distance of one, that looked like a white-washed cottage of some
poor encloser of the miserable heath upon which he was now
standing.&nbsp; Full of hope of a shelter from the storm, and,
lit onwards by the magnificent torch of heaven, the stranger trod
cheerily forwards, and in less than half an hour, making full
allowance for his retrograding between the flashes, arrived at
his beacon the white cottage, which, from the low wall of loose
limestones by which it was surrounded, he judged to be, as he had
already imagined, the humble residence of some poor tenant of the
manor.&nbsp; He opened the little gate, and was proceeding to
knock at the door, when his steps were arrested by a singular and
unexpected sound; it was a choral burst of many voices, singing
slowly and solemnly that magnificent dirge of the church of
England, the 104th psalm.&nbsp; The stranger loved music, and the
sombrous melody of that fine air had an instant effect upon his
feelings; he lingered in solemn and silent admiration till the
majestic strain had ceased; he then knocked gently at the door,
which was instantly and courteously opened to his inquiry.</p>
<p>On entering, he found himself in a cottage of a more
respectable interior than from its outward appearance he had been
led to expect: but he had little leisure or inclination for the
survey of its effects, for his senses and imagination were
immediately and entirely occupied by the scene which presented
itself on his entrance.&nbsp; In the centre of the room into
which he had been so readily admitted, stood, on its tressels, an
open coffin; lights were at its head and foot, and on each side
sat many persons of both sexes, who <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>appeared to be engaged in the
customary ceremony of watching the corse previous to its
interment in the morning.&nbsp; There were many who appeared to
the stranger to be watchers, but there were but two who, in his
eye, bore the appearance of mourners, and they had faces of grief
which spoke too plainly of the anguish that was mingling within:
one, at the foot of the coffin, was a pale youth just blooming
into manhood, who covered his dewy eyes with trembling fingers
that ill concealed the tears which trickled down his wan cheeks
beneath: the other&mdash;; but why should we again describe that
still unbowed and lofty form?&nbsp; The awful marble brow upon
which the stranger gazed, was that of Ruth Tudor.</p>
<p>There was much whispering and quiet talk among the people
while refreshments were handed amongst them; and so little
curiosity was excited by the appearance of the traveller, that he
naturally concluded that it must be no common loss that could
deaden a feeling usually so intense in the bosoms of Welsh
peasants; he was even checked for an attempt to question; but one
man,&mdash;he who had given him admittance, and seemed to possess
authority in the circle,&mdash;told him he would answer his
questions when the guests should depart, but till then he must
keep silence.&nbsp; The traveller endeavoured to obey, and sat
down in quiet contemplation of the figure who most interested his
attention, and who sat at the coffin&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Ruth
Tudor spoke nothing, nor did she appear to heed aught of the
business that was passing around her.&nbsp; Absorbed by
reflection, her eyes were generally cast to the ground; but when
they were raised, the traveller looked in vain for that
expression of grief which had struck him so <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>forcibly on
his entrance; there was something wonderful strange in the
character of her perfect features: could he have found words for
his thought, and might have been permitted the expression, he
would have called it triumphant despair; so deeply agonised, so
proudly stern, looked the mourner that sat by the dead.</p>
<p>The interest which the traveller took in the scene became more
intense the longer he gazed upon its action; unable to resist the
anxiety which had begun to prey upon his spirit, he arose and
walked towards the coffin, with the purpose of contemplating its
inhabitant: a sad explanation was given, by its appearance, of
the grief and the anguish he had witnessed; a beautiful girl was
reposing in the narrow house, with a face as calm and lovely as
if she but slept a deep and refreshing sleep, and the morning sun
would again smile upon her awakening: salt, the emblem of the
immortal soul, was placed upon her breast; and, in her pale and
perishing fingers, a branch of living flowers were struggling for
life in the grasp of death, and diffusing their sweet and
gracious fragrance over the cold odour of mortality.&nbsp; These
images, so opposite, yet so alike, affected the spirit of the
gazer, and he almost wept as he continued looking upon them, till
he was aroused from his trance by the strange conduct of Ruth
Tudor, who had caught a glimpse of his face as he bent in sorrow
over the coffin.&nbsp; She sprung up from her seat, and darting
at him a terrible glance of recognition, pointed down to the
corse, and then with a hollow burst of frantic laughter,
shouted&mdash;&ldquo;Behold, thou liar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The startled stranger was relieved from the necessity of
speaking by some one taking his arm <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and gently leading him to the farther
end of the cottage; the eyes of Ruth followed him, and it was not
till he had done violence to himself in turning from her to his
conductor, that he could escape their singular fascination.&nbsp;
When he did so he beheld a venerable old man, the pastor of a
distant village, who had come that night to speak comfort to the
mourners, and perform the last sad duty to the dead on the
morrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be not alarmed at what you have witnessed,
my young friend,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;these ravings are not
uncommon: this unhappy woman, at an early period of her life,
gave ear to the miserable superstitions of her country, and a
wretched pretender to wisdom predicted that she should become a
shedder of blood: madness has been the inevitable consequence in
an ardent spirit, and in its ravings she dreams she has committed
one sin, and is still tempted to add to it another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say what you please, parson,&rdquo; said the
old man who had given admittance to the stranger, and who now,
after dismissing all the guests save the youth, joined the
talkers, and seated himself on the settle by their sides;
&ldquo;you may say what you please about madness and
superstition; but I know Ruth Tudor was a fated woman, and the
deed that was to be I believe she has done: aye, aye, her madness
is conscience; and if the deep sea and the jagged rocks could
speak, they might tell us a tale of other things that: but she is
judged now; her only child is gone&mdash;her poor Rachel.&nbsp;
Poor Evan! he was her suitor: ah, he little thought two months
ago, when he was preparing for a gay bridal, that her slight
sickness would end thus: <i>he</i> does not deserve it; but for
her&mdash;God forgive me if I do <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>her wrong, but I think it is the hand
of God, and it lies heavy, as it should.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
grey-haired old man hobbled away, satisfied that in thus thinking
he was shewing his zeal for virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, that so white a head should acknowledge so hard a
heart!&rdquo; said the pastor; &ldquo;Ruth is condemned,
according to his system, for committing that which a mightier
hand compelled her to do; how harsh and misjudging is age!&nbsp;
But we must not speak so loud,&rdquo; continued he; &ldquo;for
see, the youth Evan is retiring for the night, and the miserable
mother has thrown herself on the floor to sleep; the sole
domestic is rocking on her stool, and therefore I will do the
honours of this poor cottage to you.&nbsp; There is a chamber
above this, containing the only bed in the hut; thither you may
go and rest, for otherwise it will certainly be vacant to-night:
I shall find a bed in the village; and Evan sleeps near you with
some of the guests in the barn.&nbsp; But, before I go, if my
question be not unwelcome and intrusive, tell me who you are, and
whither you are bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was ever somewhat of a subscriber to the old
man&rsquo;s creed of fatalism,&rdquo; said the stranger, smiling,
&ldquo;and I believe I am more confirmed in it by the singular
events of this day.&nbsp; My father was a man of a certain rank
in society, but of selfish and disorderly habits.&nbsp; A course
of extravagance and idleness was succeeded by difficulties and
distress.&nbsp; Harassed by creditors, he was pained by their
demands, and his selfishness was unable to endure the sufferings
of his wife and children.&nbsp; Instead of exertion, he had
recourse to flight, and left us to face the difficulties from
which he shrunk.&nbsp; He was absent for years, while his family
toiled and struggled with success.&nbsp; Suddenly <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>we heard that
he was concealed in this part of the coast; the cause which made
that concealment necessary I forbear to mention; but he as
suddenly disappeared from the eyes of men, though we never could
trace him beyond this part of the country.&nbsp; I have always
believed that I should one day find my father, and have lately,
though with difficulty, prevailed upon my mother to allow me to
make my inquiries in this neighbourhood; but my search is at an
end to-day,&mdash;I believe that I have found my father.&nbsp;
Roaming along the beach, I penetrated into several of those dark
caverns of the rocks, which might well, by their rugged aspects,
deter the idle and the timid from entering.&nbsp; Through the
fissures of one I discovered, in the interior, a light.&nbsp;
Surprised, I penetrated to its concealment, and discovered a man
sleeping on the ground.&nbsp; I advanced to awake him, and found
but a fleshless skeleton, cased in tattered and decaying
garments.&nbsp; He had probably met his death by accident, for
exactly over the corpse I observed, at a terrific distance, the
daylight, as if streaming down from an aperture above.&nbsp; Thus
the wretched man must have fallen, but how long since, or who had
discovered his body, and left the light which I beheld, I knew
not, though I cannot help cherishing a strong conviction that it
was the body of Rhys Meredith that I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who talks of Rhys Meredith,&rdquo; said a stern voice
near the coffin, &ldquo;and of the cave where the outcast
rots?&rdquo;&nbsp; They turned quickly at the sound, and beheld
Ruth Tudor standing up, as if she had been intently listening to
the story.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was I who spoke, dame,&rdquo; said the
stranger gently, &ldquo;and my speech was of my father, of Rhys
Meredith; I am Owen his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;Son!&nbsp; Owen Rhys!&rdquo; said the bewildered
Ruth, passing her hand over her forehead, as if to enable her to
recover the combinations of these names; &ldquo;and who art thou,
that thus givest human ties to him who is no more of humanity?
why speakest thou of living things as pertaining to the
dead?&nbsp; Father! he is father of nought save sin, and murder
is his only begotten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She advanced to the traveller as she spoke, and again caught a
view of his face; again he saw the wild look of recognition, and
an unearthly shriek followed the convulsive horror of her
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I knew
it must be thyself; once before to-night have I beheld thee, yet
what can thy coming bode?&nbsp; Back with thee, ruffian! for is
not thy work done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us leave her,&rdquo; said the good pastor,
&ldquo;to the care of her attendant; do not continue to meet her
gaze, your presence may increase, but cannot allay her malady: go
up to your bed and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He retired as he spoke; and Owen, in compliance with his wish,
ascended the ruinous stair which led to his chamber, after he had
beheld Ruth Tudor quietly place herself in her seat at the open
coffin&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The room to which he mounted was not
of the most cheering aspect, yet he felt that he had often slept
soundly in a worse.&nbsp; It was a gloomy unfinished chamber, and
the wind was whistling coldly and drearily through the uncovered
rafters above his head.&nbsp; Like many of the cottages in that
part of the country, it appeared to have grown old and ruinous
before it had been finished; for the flooring was so crazy as
scarcely to support the huge wooden bedstead, and in many
instances the boards were entirely separated from each other, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and in the
centre, time, or the rot, had so completely devoured the larger
half of one, that through the gaping aperture Owen had an entire
command of the room and the party below, looking down immediately
above the coffin.&nbsp; Ruth was in the same attitude as when he
left her, and the servant girl was dozing by her side.&nbsp;
Every thing being perfectly tranquil, Owen threw himself upon his
hard couch, and endeavoured to compose himself to rest for the
night, but this had become a task, and one of no easy nature to
surmount; his thoughts still wandered to the events of the day,
and he felt there was some strange connexion between the scene he
had just witnessed, and the darker one of the secret cave.&nbsp;
He was an imaginative man, and of a quick and feverish
temperament, and he thought of Ruth Tudor&rsquo;s ravings, and
the wretched skeleton of the rock, till he had worked out in his
brain the chain of events that linked one consequence with the
other: he grew restless and wretched, and amidst the tossings of
impatient anxiety, fatigue overpowered him, and he sunk into a
perturbed and heated sleep.&nbsp; His slumber was broken by
dreams that might well be the shadows of his waking
reveries.&nbsp; He was alone (as in reality) upon his humble bed,
when imagination brought to his ear the sound of many voices
again singing the slow and monotonous psalm; it was interrupted
by the outcries of some unseen things who attempted to enter his
chamber, and, amid yells of fear and execrations of anger, bade
him &ldquo;Arise, and come forth, and aid:&rdquo; then the
coffined form which slept so quietly below, stood by his side,
and in beseeching accents, bade him &ldquo;Arise, and save
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his sleep he attempted to spring up, but <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>a horrid fear
restrained him, a fear that he should be too late; then he
crouched like a coward beneath his coverings, to hide from the
reproaches of the spectre, while shouts of laughter and shrieks
of agony were poured like a tempest around him: he sprung from
his bed and awoke.</p>
<p>It was some moments ere he could recover recollection, or
shake off the horror which had seized upon his soul.&nbsp; He
listened, and with infinite satisfaction observed an unbroken
silence throughout the house.&nbsp; He smiled at his own terrors,
attributed them to the events of the day, or the presence of a
corse, and determined not to look down into the lower room till
he should be summoned thither in the morning.&nbsp; He walked to
the casement, and looked abroad to the night; the clouds were
many, black, and lowering, and the face of the sky looked angrily
at the wind, and glared portentously upon the earth; the
<i>sleet</i> was still falling; distant thunder announced the
approach or departure of a storm, and Owen marked the clouds
coming from afar towards him, laden with the rapid and
destructive lightning: he shut the casement and returned towards
his bed; but the light from below attracted his eye, and he could
not pass the aperture without taking one glance at the party.</p>
<p>They were in the same attitude in which he had left them; the
servant was sleeping, but Ruth was earnestly gazing on the lower
end of the room upon something, without the sight of Owen; his
attention was next fixed upon the corpse, and he thought he had
never seen any living thing so lovely; and so calm was the aspect
of her last repose, that Meredith thought it more resembled a
temporary suspension of the <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>faculties, than the eternal stupor of
death: her features were pale, but not distorted, and there was
none of the livid hue of death in her beautiful mouth and lips;
but the flowers in her hand gave stronger demonstration of the
presence of the power, before whose potency their little strength
was fading; drooping with a mortal sickness, they bowed down
their heads in submission, as one by one they dropped from her
pale and perishing fingers.&nbsp; Owen gazed, till he thought he
saw the grasp of her hand relax, and a convulsive smile pass over
her cold and rigid features; he looked again; the eye-lids shook
and vibrated like the string of some fine-strung instrument; the
hair rose, and the head cloth moved: he started up ashamed:
&ldquo;Does the madness of this woman affect all who would sleep
beneath her roof?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what is this that
disturbs me&mdash;or am I yet in a dream?&nbsp; Hark! what is
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the voice of Ruth; she had risen from
her seat, and was standing near the coffin, apparently addressing
some one who stood at the lower end of the room: &ldquo;To what
purpose is thy coming now?&rdquo; said she, in a low and
melancholy voice, &ldquo;and at what dost thou laugh and gibe?
lo! you; she is here, and the sin you know of, cannot be; how can
I take the life which another hath already withdrawn?&nbsp; Go,
go, hence to thy cave of night, for this is no place of safety
for thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her thoughts now took another turn; she
seemed to hide one from the pursuit of others; &ldquo;Lie still!
lie still!&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;put out thy light! so,
so, they pass by and mark thee not; thou art safe; good night,
good night! now will I home to sleep;&rdquo; <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>and she
seated herself in her chair, as if composing her senses to
rest.</p>
<p>Owen was again bewildered in the chaos of thought, but for
this time he determined to subdue his imagination, and, throwing
himself upon his bed, again gave himself up to sleep; but the
images of his former dreams still haunted him, and their hideous
phantasms were more powerfully renewed; again he heard the solemn
psalm of death, but unsung by mortals&mdash;it was pealed through
earth up to the high heaven, by myriads of the viewless and the
mighty: again he heard the execrations of millions for some
unremembered sin, and the wrath and the hatred of a world was
rushing upon him: &ldquo;Come forth! come forth!&rdquo; was the
cry; and amid yells and howls they were darting upon him, when
the pale form of the beautiful dead arose between them, and
shielded him from their malice; but he heard her say aloud,
&ldquo;It is for this, that thou wilt not save me; arise, arise,
and help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprung up as he was commanded; sleeping or waking he never
knew; but he started from his bed to look down into the chamber,
as he heard the voice of Ruth loud in terrific denunciation: he
looked; she was standing, uttering yells of madness and rage, and
close to her was a well-known form of appalling
recollection&mdash;his father, as he had seen him last; he arose
and darted to the door: &ldquo;I am mad,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I
am surely mad, or this is still a continuation of my
dream:&rdquo; he looked again; Ruth was still there, but
alone.</p>
<p>But, though no visible form stood by the maniac, some fiend
had entered her soul, and mastered her mighty spirit; she had
armed herself <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>with an axe, and shouting, &ldquo;Liar, liar,
hence!&rdquo; was pursuing some imaginary foe to the darker side
of the cottage: Owen strove hard to trace her motions, but as she
had retreated under the space occupied by his bed, he could no
longer see her, and his eyes involuntarily fastened themselves
upon the coffin; there a new horror met them; the dead corpse had
risen, and with wild and glaring eyes was watching the scene
before her.&nbsp; Owen distrusted his senses till he heard the
terrific voice of Ruth, as she marked the miracle he had
witnessed; &ldquo;The fiend, the robber!&rdquo; she yelled,
&ldquo;it is he who hath entered the pure body of my child.&nbsp;
Back to thy cave of blood, thou lost one! back to thine own dark
hell!&rdquo;&nbsp; Owen flew to the door; it was too late; he
heard the shriek&mdash;the blow: he <i>fell</i> into the room,
but only in time to hear the second blow, and see the cleft hand
of the hapless Rachel fall back upon its bloody pillow; his
terrible cries brought in the sleepers from the barn, headed by
the wretched Evan, and, for a time, the thunders of heaven were
drowned in the clamorous grief of man.&nbsp; No one dared to
approach the miserable Ruth, who now, in utter frenzy, strode
around the room, brandishing, with diabolical grandeur, the
bloody axe, and singing a wild song of triumph and joy.&nbsp; All
fell back as she approached, and shrunk from the infernal majesty
of her terrific form; and the thunders of heaven rolling above
their heads, and the flashings of the fires of eternity in their
eyes, were less terrible than the savage glare and desperate
wrath of the maniac:&mdash;suddenly, the house rocked to its
foundation; its inmates were blinded for a moment, and sunk,
felled by a stunning blow, to the earth;&mdash;slowly each man <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>recovered and
arose, wondering he was yet alive;&mdash;all were unhurt, save
one.&nbsp; Ruth Tudor was on the earth, her blackened limbs
prostrate beneath the coffin of her child, and her dead cheek
resting on the rent and bloody axe;&mdash;it had been the
destroyer of both.</p>
<h2><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>THE
YELLOW DWARF.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A TALE OF THE ORANGE TREE.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Oranges and Lemons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> body knows, or at least ought
to know, with what an uproar of delight the birth of an heir to
any noble family was celebrated in the old baronial times of
fisty-cuff memory; exactly such a festival would we, the humble
historian of the illustrious house of Tecklenburgh, describe if
we knew how to render justice to the outrageous mirth which shook
the old castle to its very foundation, on the day of the eventful
morn on which the lady of the eldest son of the family had
presented her lord, and his no less expecting father the count,
with a new prop to the seat of their ancient dignities.&nbsp; It
was amid the mingled uproar of trumpets, bells, soldiers, women,
horses, and dogs, that the respectable purple-nosed dominican,
who was confessor to the family, gave a blessing and a name to
its future representative; and immediately after the ceremony,
the knights and nobles, wearied by the blows given and received
in the jousts, retired to the dining hall with the threefold
intention of filling their empty stomachs with something better
than the east wind, solacing their spirits with the biting jests
of the count&rsquo;s fool, and curing their wounds and bruises of
the morning by bathing them in flagons of rhenish, till the moon
should look down upon the evening.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>But
happiness will not endure for ever, like riches, she maketh
herself wings and fleeth away: the company, after picking the
flesh of the huge wild boar to the bone, began to stare at each
other with bleared eyes, ask querulous questions with stuttering
tongues, and reply with solemn and important visages; and the
count of Tecklenburgh, fearing that his youngest son, the
handsome Sir Ludolph, would soon grow as wise as the rest of the
party, and of course utterly unfit for business, withdrew him
quietly from the table and conducted him to his private
apartment; there, seating himself in his state chair and enrobing
his person, with an air of paternal dignity he solemnly demanded
of his son, if he had, according to his particular order,
considered the subject of their last conference.&nbsp; The young
knight answered, without any hesitation, that he had not, for
that the subject was so disagreeable to him that he had never
suffered it to enter his mind since; that he thought the tonsure
excessively unbecoming, and that he had no inclination to pray
every time St. Benedict&rsquo;s bells should ring; and he added
moreover, that he was resolved to carve himself out a fortune
with his sword, and for that purpose intended to set off
immediately for the court of the injured princes of Thuringia,
whose cause was a just and honourable one, and make them an offer
of his services: all this was said with an air of so much
determination and composure, as partly to disturb, and partly to
amuse the gravity of the count of Tecklenburgh; but considering
within himself for a few moments, he thought this last project of
his son was not quite so foolish as he had at first been willing
to imagine it.&nbsp; In addition to high courage and <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>many knightly
acquirements, Ludolph possessed a very handsome person, and this
idea connecting itself with the beautiful sister of the princes
of Thuringia, he began to think that it would be a pity to hide
that fine form under a greasy cassock; he reflected that should
the three sons of Albert the Depraved get their brains knocked
out in the skirmish, (a consummation devoutly to be wished, and,
from their warlike character and powerful enemies, very likely to
happen,) their possessions would descend to their sister, who
might possibly fall in love with his handsome son, and then
possibly the margraviate of Thuringia might finally centre in his
family.&nbsp; These, and many other possibilities working in the
brain of father Tecklenburgh, worked a change in his countenance
also; and Ludolph seeing a smile, or something like one, hovering
over his iron features, judged it a favourable opportunity for
re-enforcing his petition, which he did with all the zeal and
eloquence he could muster&mdash;eloquence which touched the heart
of his tender father, for he assured him that if he would permit
him to depart, he would not draw the smallest piece of copper
from his treasury to fit him out for the expedition, but would
make his aunt&rsquo;s legacy of relics answer every
purpose.&nbsp; This last remonstrance settled the business; count
Tecklenburgh, finding it was to cost him nothing, gave his
consent to the measure, and made his son happy in his own way,
though, if that happiness had cost him a single cruitzner, he
would have held fast to the tonsure in spite of all the
repugnance of poor Ludolph; as it was, he gave him his blessing,
and dismissed him with much good advice, but not a single coin,
and the knight was too happy <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>in the granted permission to grieve
at his father&rsquo;s lack of liberality.&nbsp; With a lightened
heart he went for his holy legacy, which he found much heavier
than he had expected; every bone and rag was carefully marked
with the name of its original owner, and, after getting the monk
to read him their titles, and affix a value to each article, he
hastened to dispose of his sanctified treasure.&nbsp; He imagined
the most likely persons to bid handsomely for his commodities
would be the monks, who paid such respectful and humble reverence
to cargoes of that description; but, after visiting a convent of
Dominicans situated near the castle, in this instance he found
himself most grievously mistaken; these holy pedlars were much
too wise to buy what they had long found their account in
selling: they had already a good stock on hand, and, when this
should be exhausted, they could manufacture others at a much
cheaper rate than they could purchase them of count Ludolph: so
he carried his legacy to the nuns, who rejected it
instantaneously, doubting whether the articles were
genuine.&nbsp; From the nuns he went to all the orders of
mendicants, who treated him and his relics with great contempt,
cried down his cargo, and impudently asserted that the leg of St.
Bridget, which he had considered the most valuable article in the
pious collection, was the leg of a woman who was hung some years
before for sorcery in Nuremburg, as they themselves had the real
original limb of the saint in their possession.&nbsp; Thus
disappointed among the shorn lambs of the fold, Ludolph
determined to seek for purchasers among the laity, and
accordingly found them in the persons of priest-ridden princes,
crusading nobles, pilgrim knights, and convent-founding <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>ladies: the
great variety of his good aunt&rsquo;s collection enabled him to
gratify the tastes of all, for his box contained one member or
other of every saint mentioned in the monk of Treves&rsquo;s
martyrology.&nbsp; St. Bridget&rsquo;s leg he sold at a high
price to a miserable old noble who had grown rich by rapine, and
who trusted by this measure to scare away the goblins and
spectres who nightly kept their revels round his bed.&nbsp; The
thumb of St. Austin was purchased by a beautiful princess, as the
guard of her chastity amid the allurements of a court, and was
suspended like a camphor bag around her delicate neck; while the
illustrious mother of a reprobate young knight earnestly hoped,
by tacking a piece of the hair shirt of St. Jerome to the shirt
of her son, to effect a reformation in his morals, and an
amendment in his manners.&nbsp; There were always abundance of
fools in the world, and in those unlettered times it did not
require the light of a lantern to look for them.&nbsp; Ludolph
thought so, as, with a lightened box but a heavy purse, he
returned to Tecklenburgh to fit out for his expedition.&nbsp;
Hosen, boots, vests, tunics, hoods, harness, and arms, were all
ready in a short time; for when a man has money, every thing else
under the sun is very much at his service.&nbsp; His appointments
were all of the handsomest kind; his device was a boar, and his
colours were blue and scarlet.&nbsp; And thus, having equipped
the knight and sent him forward, let us look back for a little,
to ascertain whither he is going, and for what purpose when he
shall arrive there.</p>
<p>The cause of the princes of Thuringia was, as count Ludolph
had truly stated, a just and honourable one: their father, Albert
the Depraved, <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>had disinherited them, and banished their mother, in
favour of a worthless mistress and his illegitimate son, for whom
he anxiously endeavoured to procure the investiture of his
dominions after his decease.&nbsp; Not succeeding in this notable
project, and bent upon the ruin of his own children, he sold his
landgraviate of Misnia to the emperor Adolphus, who dying before
he could be benefited by his purchase, bequeathed this right, to
which he had no right at all, to his brother Philip of Nassau,
who, poor in character, and still poorer in purse, was now
levying an army, aided by the emperor Albert, to deprive the
legitimate heir, Frederic with the Bite, and his brother Dictman,
of their rights and possessions.&nbsp; To this project they were
by no means disposed to consent, more especially as their mother,
Margaret, daughter of Frederic the Redbeard, continually kept
alive their resentment against their worthless father and his
abandoned associates.&nbsp; This princess, on being years before
separated from her children by her husband, had requested
permission to take leave of them ere their departure, which being
granted, she, in the frenzy of rage and grief, left a singular
memorial of her wrongs with her eldest son; she bit a piece out
of his cheek, and the impression remaining upon his face for
ever, inflamed his indignation against the original author of
this disfigurement; so that, when capable of bearing arms, he
deposed his father and assumed his place, to thrust him from
which Philip of Nassau was now threatening, and to oppose whom
half Germany was rising in arms to assist the cheek-bitten
Frederic, and among many others the knight of Tecklenburgh.</p>
<p>Margaret of Suabia, the mother of the princes, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>during the
early part of her life, had been confined by her husband in the
castle of Wartzburg, in order that she might be removed the more
readily into a still smaller abode, whenever the proper
opportunity should occur, and which he piously determined not to
neglect.&nbsp; She was at this period in a situation which might
have interested any man but such a husband, for she promised to
increase his illustrious family by an additional son or daughter;
but as he cared for no children but the son of his mistress
Cunegunda, this circumstance rather operated against the poor
princess, who was left to amuse herself as well as she could in
superintending the infancy of her sons, and hunting in the
haunted forest of Eisenac.&nbsp; One day, while thus diverting
her attention from the many anxieties which oppressed her, she
found herself suddenly separated from her attendants; but hearing
a horn sound to the right, she spurred on her palfrey in that
direction, till, after an hour&rsquo;s hard riding, she began to
fear she was removing still further from her people, for no sound
could she hear but that of the eternal bugle, no hoof-tramp but
that of her own steed.&nbsp; Still the horn sounded, and still
the princess galloped, till at length wearied by her exercise,
and finding herself in a large open plain, she dismounted to
reconnoitre; at the same moment she remarked the silence of the
horn, and the appearance of a gigantic orange tree, loaded with
fine fruit, in the centre of the tranquil plain.&nbsp;
Astonishment she certainly felt on beholding so extraordinary and
beautiful an object; but hunger and fatigue had entirely banished
all notions of fear; besides, dame Margaret, having no small
share of the curiosity of her grandmother Eve, <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>could no more
resist the temptation of tasting these oranges, than the first
woman did the apple; so climbing up into the tree, she regaled
herself to her heart&rsquo;s content with this fine fruit of the
forest.&nbsp; By the time she had fairly dined, and was as weary
of eating as she had previously been of riding, she bethought her
of the boys at home, and with what glee they would have marched
to the sack of the orange tree; but as that was not possible, she
determined they should not be without share of the spoil, and
therefore began to fill her huge pockets with the ripest and the
largest of the fruit.&nbsp; But this action displeased the
hospitable master of the table at which she had been so
plentifully regaled; &ldquo;Eat, but take nothing away,&rdquo;
had been one of his maxims, and he was mortally offended to see
this honest rule set at nought in the person of a princess, a
lady who, he thought, ought to have understood better
manners.&nbsp; Before, therefore, <i>she</i> had laid up
provisions for the march, a little shrill voice from the tree
commanded her highness &ldquo;not to steal his fruit,&rdquo; and,
at the same instant, there issued from the trunk which opened to
give him a passage, a figure which effectually satisfied the
curiosity of the princess of Suabia.&nbsp; The animal which now
quickly ascended the tree, and placed himself <i>vis &agrave;
vis</i> with her highness, was a little deformed man, about three
feet and a half high, with a face as yellow as the oranges upon
which he lived, hair of the same hue hanging down to his heels,
and a monstrous beard, of the same bilious complexion, gracefully
descending to his feet; if you add to this, the gaiety of his
yellow doublet, short cloak, and hose, you will not wonder that
Margaret did not altogether relish the <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span><i>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</i>
in which she found herself so suddenly and singularly placed,
independent of the awkwardness of paying a first visit in the
boughs of a tree.&nbsp; &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; said the little
yellow devil, after staring at her some time with his two huge
goggling yellow eyes, &ldquo;what business have you
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have lost my way,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;and being fatigued, was going to gather an orange to
appease my hunger:&rdquo; but he, without the least respect for
his guest, or the rank of an emperor&rsquo;s daughter, rudely
answered, &ldquo;Woman, you lie! you were stealing my property to
carry away.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this insolent reproach, Margaret,
whose patience was never proverbial, felt a strong inclination to
treat the demon as she afterwards did her son; but fearing that
the little gentleman might not endure it quite so temperately,
prudently restrained this effort of her indignation, and only
said, &ldquo;I did not know the tree had any other owner than
myself, or I would not have gathered any; what I have eaten I
cannot restore, but here is the last I have taken;&rdquo; and she
threw it rather roughly at the Dwarf, who, irritated excessively
at this behaviour, told her, grinning hideously, and exhibiting
for her admiration his monstrous overgrown yellow claws, that he
had a strong temptation to tear her to pieces, which nothing but
his wish to be allied to the blood of the emperors should have
prevented.&nbsp; &ldquo;My oranges,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which
you have stolen, I estimate above all price, except that which I
am going to demand: I am a powerful demon, and rule with
unbounded sway many thousand spirits; but I am unhappy in not
having a wife with whom to share my power; as Adam was not
delighted in Paradise, neither am I in my Orange <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Tree, without
a companion.&nbsp; You are about to present an infant to your
lord, who is utterly indifferent about the matter; it will be a
girl, and I demand her in marriage on the day she will be twenty
years old: consent to be my mother, and I will avenge your
injuries upon your husband, and load you with honours and riches;
refuse, and I will tear you in pieces this moment, and furnish my
supper table with your carcass.&rdquo;&nbsp; Margaret, who had
never been so terrified in all her life, and would not only have
given her daughter, but her sons and husband into the bargain, to
have got away, readily promised to agree with the Dwarf&rsquo;s
wishes, who now became exceedingly polite, embraced his dear
mother, and assured her of his devotion.&nbsp; He then informed
her he would give her notice some months before he should claim
his wife, placed her carefully and tenderly upon her palfrey, and
mounting behind, spurred on the animal, who flew like the wind to
the entrance of the forest; where again embracing his good
mother, he dismounted and disappeared.&nbsp; Margaret, freed from
the odious company of the Yellow Dwarf, began to reflect with no
very pleasant feelings upon her present adventure and future
prospects.&nbsp; She was, indeed, safe out of the orange-coloured
clutches of her dutiful and well-beloved son; and, vexed as she
was by the horrible promise she had been obliged to make, she
could not help congratulating herself with great sincerity upon
this circumstance, and began, like all who have just escaped a
present danger, to make light of the evils in the distance.&nbsp;
The farther she cantered from the Orange Tree, the easier her
mind became; and taking a few hints from &ldquo;Time, the
comforter,&rdquo; she reflected that <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>many things might occur before the
expiration of twenty years: it was a long period to look forward;
the little yellow devil might die, (and, indeed, she could not
but allow that he looked most miserably ill,) or he might forget
his bargain, or he might be conquered and killed by some black,
pea-green, or true blue devil, who might be stronger or more
powerful than himself; or, in case of the worst, she could secure
her daughter in some strong castle or convent, or marry her,
before the expiration of the term, to some prince capable of
protecting her; at all events, thought Margaret,
&ldquo;sufficient to the day is the evil thereof;&rdquo; and,
delighted by these soothing reflections, and charmed to find
herself in a whole skin, she trotted along with great
complacency, and arrived quite comforted before the gates of
Wartzburg.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These yellow cowslip cheeks,<br />
And eyes as green as leeks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Twenty</span> years is indeed a long
period to look forward, but a very short one to look back, and so
thought the now widowed princess, when, nineteen years and some
months after her adventure in the forest, she sat beside her
lovely daughter in the palace of Erfurt, listening with earnest
and tender attention to the plans of her warlike sons for
wresting their dominions from the iron grasp of Albert the
One-eyed and Philip of Nassau.&nbsp; It was necessary that they
should give battle to their enemies; and as the margrave of
Misnia intended to fight for his country in <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>person, this
would unavoidably deprive her beloved daughter of that powerful
protection which hitherto had been her security against the
threats of the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; It now wanted but six months
of the period when he had determined to claim his bride; and as
he had not hitherto given any indication, according to his word,
of his appearance for this purpose, she trusted he might have
forgotten it altogether, and, quietly resolving not to complain
of this breach of promise, forebore to mention the subject to her
children.</p>
<p>One day, during the bustle of preparation for the approaching
warfare, a knight, splendidly attired, arrived at the palace, and
demanded to be introduced to the princess Margaret, who no sooner
beheld him, than she recognised in the colour of his arms the
livery of her dear son-in-law, the Dwarf of the Orange
Tree.&nbsp; He announced himself as the knight of the king of the
oranges, and his embassy was to place abundance of gold at the
feet of the princess Margaret, and to carry away her daughter as
the bride of his master.&nbsp; Concealment was no longer
possible, so sending for her children, she informed them of her
forest adventure, and its unfortunate result.&nbsp; Poor Brunilda
fainted away; her brothers swore as lustily as ever queen
Elizabeth did, and fairly bullied the knight ambassador for his
presumption in daring to think of their sister as a helpmate for
the little dirty low-lived sorcerer his master; and Margaret, who
before their entrance had been absolutely terrified to death by
his presence, now finding herself protected, suffered her tongue
to wag at a most unconscionable rate against the poor
ambassador.&nbsp; She told him she had a great mind to cut off
his ears, for bringing her such a message; <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>that his
master was a little conceited monster; that if, with all this
gold and silver, he would buy a fine castle, cut off his beard,
and live like a gentleman, he should not want her interest with
one of the dairy-maids, but as it was, the thing was utterly
impossible, he would not succeed even with the lowest
scullion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied the knight, with a
grim kind of gravity, which was not half relished by the
princess, &ldquo;I would have you to understand I came not hither
to bandy words with you, nor to listen to a catalogue of my
master&rsquo;s perfections: I must, however, inform you, that he
would not part from his Orange Tree, nor with his beard, for all
the princesses in the universe, the fair Brunilda included.&nbsp;
If you do not think proper to keep your promise, he will find
means to oblige you: neither does he require human aid to obtain
his betrothed bride; but his gallantry and good nature will not
allow him to force the will of the fair princess, if he can
relinquish his determination with honour.&nbsp; He is fully aware
of your present repugnance to his nuptials, and he is now
whispering me to say, that if the princess herself declines his
vows (which he can hardly believe), he will release her upon
condition of her finding a champion that shall conquer me, and
afterwards my invincible master, before the six months have
expired, in single combat on horseback, on foot, with lance or
sword, according to his highness&rsquo;s good pleasure at the
time of meeting: shall I say these terms are
accepted?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You may,&rdquo; replied the
margrave, to whom these conditions did not appear very hard, and
who thought it better to comply with than refuse them, as he was
not aware of the strength of the enemy to whom his <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>mother&rsquo;s promise had really been given; and he
remembered he should probably be compelled to leave his lovely
sister unprotected, while absent on his distant wars.&nbsp; The
arrangements were, therefore, soon made, and the yellow champion
was satisfied.</p>
<p>And now a splendid scene opened to view in the territories of
Frederic with the bitten cheek.&nbsp; No sooner each day had the
bells rung out the hour of prime, than the trumpet sounded to
proclaim the challenge of the yellow knight, and the promise of
the margrave of Misnia, that the successful champion of the fair
Brunilda should obtain her hand for his reward.&nbsp; Day after
day did some knight essay the adventure; and day after day did
the noble Margaret enter the lists, attended by her lovely
daughter, who looked through her fan of peacock&rsquo;s feathers,
as charming, and carried herself as &ldquo;daintily,&rdquo; as
whilom did the beauteous Esther, when she entered into the
presence of the loving Ahasuerus.&nbsp; But not like that
beautiful daughter of the scorners of pork did she obtain her
petition; for day after day was she compelled to witness the ruin
of her hopes in the repeated triumphs of the yellow Haman over
her own black, brown, or party-coloured champions: knight after
knight fell beneath his ponderous arm, and were obliged to resign
their claims to the fair Brunilda, to her infinite regret, and
their bitter mortification.&nbsp; Already had the counts of
Wartzburg, Oettingen, Henneberg, Hanau, and Conrad of Reida, been
compelled to acknowledge the superiority of his powerful arm,
when the arrival of the handsome knight of Tecklenburgh, who just
came in time to hear a week&rsquo;s rest proclaimed, in order to
gain time for the approach of <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>other knights from the most distant
parts of Germany to the aid of the endangered princess, revived
the hopes of Brunilda.&nbsp; He came, he saw, he
conquered&mdash;not the sword of the yellow champion, but the
heart of the charming princess, which was formed of too tender
materials to hold out against so well-looking and redoubted a
warrior: she fell instantly in love with him to distraction, and
he, on his part, was too well bred to be behind-hand.&nbsp; In
the extravagance of her fondness, she thought all things possible
to her lover, and made no doubt that he would be victorious in
the combat.&nbsp; Ludolph was precisely of the same opinion, and
to manifest its justice, was most irritably impatient for the day
of combat, which was still at the distance of several halting
sun-risings and sun-settings, which that long-legged old
ragamuffin Time did not carry off, in the opinion of the lovers,
quite so rapidly as he ought to have done.</p>
<p>But it came at last, that day, that morning of miracles; it
came, and brought nothing with it to daunt the brave spirit of
the knight of Tecklenburgh.&nbsp; Light as the plume in his
casque, gay as the colours of his harness, he entered the lists,
and gallantly opposed his person against the ponderous carcase of
the yellow-coloured champion.&nbsp; Blow after blow was freely
given, and as freely received, till the spectators began to doubt
whether either of the men before them was really made of flesh
and blood.&nbsp; Proof decisive, however, was soon given, for the
sword of Ludolph cleft the helmet of his antagonist, and dashed
his weapon from his hand, so that, defenceless and at the mercy
of his conqueror, he yielded up his claim to victory, and was
content to beg <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>his life.&nbsp; The acclamations of the people proved to
Ludolph the difficulty of the conquest he had just
achieved.&nbsp; The nobles were all anxious to testify their
esteem and admiration, though some in their hearts were bursting
with envy, and felt themselves almost choked by the fine things
they thought it necessary to utter.&nbsp; Ludolph took them all
in good faith with perfect confidence in their sincerity, for he
was too happy and too honest to suspect; and then turning to the
poor champion, whom he hardly allowed time to recover breath,
recommended him to return to his little lord, and bear his
defiance, as he should quietly wait to fulfil the last condition
ere he received the hand of the beautiful Brunilda.&nbsp; The
Yellow Champion took the advice thus kindly offered him, and
quitted the palace of Erfurt, leaving his conqueror busy enough
in accepting those disinterested professions of service which are
seldom offered except to those who do not want them, or from whom
an adequate return may not unreasonably be expected.</p>
<p>Ludolph waited with great impatience the Dwarf&rsquo;s reply
to his challenge.&nbsp; His time was passed, meanwhile, in making
love to the princess (who on her part was tolerably well disposed
to listen to him), and laying up a stock of devotion, by prayer
and fasting, to serve, as occasion should warrant, in the
approaching combat with the demon, of whose power he had formed
other notions, since his residence in the Misnian court, than
either thinking him so harmless or so insignificant as he had
formerly done.&nbsp; But the days rolled on, and no dwarf
appeared.&nbsp; Margaret, who sincerely admired the valour of
Ludolph, was anxious to end his suspense, and <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Brunilda&rsquo;s terrors, by uniting him at once to her
daughter, without waiting for the presence of the Lord of the
Orange Tree, of whom she could never think without shuddering;
but the margrave, who, much as he loved his sister and her noble
deliverer, was too much of a gentleman to break his word, even
with a dwarf, determined they should stay the full time allotted
by the demon.&nbsp; The latter was too gallant, and too much in
love with the princess, to forget his engagement, and accordingly
one morning, as the trumpets were sounding the usual summons to
the lists, the Dwarf himself entered them in his customary dress,
mounted upon a yellow steed, and surrounded by a large troop of
knights in his colours.&nbsp; The nobles and ladies of the
margrave&rsquo;s court, struck by the oddity of his appearance,
entirely forgot their politeness, and burst into as hearty and
unanimous a laugh as ever was heard in our lower House at any of
Joe H&mdash;&rsquo;s blunders.&nbsp; But it was no laughing
matter to Brunilda: she saw, for the first time, her intended
husband, and she felt that his ugliness even exceeded her
mother&rsquo;s report, and heaven knows that had not been
flattering.&nbsp; She cast a look of tender entreaty upon
Ludolph, who, impatient to punish his rival and relieve her
anxiety, couched his lance, and spurred forward to meet the
demon, who, not to be behind-hand in courtesy, advanced to
receive him.&nbsp; But the knight suddenly sprung back, on
observing the singular dress of his adversary, the extraordinary
lightness of those accoutrements struck him with
astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir knight of the Orange Tree,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;except the lance in your hand and the sword in
your belt, I see no sort of preparation for a combat; sheathe
your <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>person in harness, I pray you, that so at least the
chances may be more equal between us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
that to thee?&rdquo; replied the Dwarf; &ldquo;it is my pleasure
to fight in these garments: thief as thou art, conquer me in them
if thou canst.&nbsp; For thee, sweet lady, I am here, to prove my
right to thy hand, to rescue it from this craven, and fear not
but I shall deserve it: my palace is ready, thy dowry is ready,
and twice a thousand slaves wait to obey thy wishes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ludolph could not endure this insolence, so rushing forward as
the yellow knights retired from the person of their leader, he
began a most furious attack upon the animal who pretended to
rival him in the affections of his lady.&nbsp; Alas! poor
Brunilda! if she had trembled before, during the combats with the
yellow knight, what anxiety must not have filled her bosom
now!&nbsp; The lances were soon shivered to pieces: the champions
drew their swords, but seemed to make very little impression with
them.&nbsp; Ludolph had not yet received a wound, and
yellow-jacket seemed determined to make good his boast, and hold
the knight of Tecklenburgh a tug.&nbsp; Vain was all the skill
and strength of the latter; though he struck with all his might
and main, and heart and soul, he could not cut through a single
hair of the Dwarf&rsquo;s long beard, which seemed to wag at him
in derision.&nbsp; Poor Brunilda sat as uneasily upon her
canopied throne as if she had been upon a bed of nettles.&nbsp;
She prayed to all the saints in heaven, and St. Henry the Limper
in particular, to assist her dear knight in this terrible combat:
but St. Henry the Limper was not in good humour, or was otherwise
engaged, for he did not appear to pay the least attention to her
request, and Ludolph was left to <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>fight it out by himself as he
could.&nbsp; In truth, he did not want inclination to put an end
to the business.&nbsp; After pegging and poking at every inch of
the Dwarf&rsquo;s invulnerable carcass, he espied a little
unguarded spot on the left side of his throat, exactly open to
his right hand.&nbsp; Delighted by the prospect of slicing off
his ragamuffin head, he aimed a mighty blow with all his force,
which the little demon parried; he struck a second with no better
success; but the third was triumphant, for it sent the yellow
head flying from his shoulders, and bounding to another part of
the area.&nbsp; The knight leaped from his saddle to seize the
head and hold it up to the view of the people; but in this race,
to his horror, he was outstripped by the Dwarf himself, who
likewise, darting from his horse, flew to the head, grasped it
firmly, gave it a shake, clapped it upon his shoulders, and fixed
it again as firmly and steadily as ever.&nbsp; Then, ere the
spectators could recover from the stupor into which this
unexpected contretemps had thrown them, he struck the staring
Ludolph to the ground, seized the princess by her flowing locks,
swung her behind him, and bolted out of the area.&nbsp; His
knights wheeled round to follow him, but the Misnian nobles,
recovering from their confusion, surrounded them with drawn
swords, and began a desperate battle, in which it appeared they
clearly had the worst, only hacking and hewing each other; for
the knights, squires, pages, and horses of the enemy suddenly
vanished from their sight, and in their places appeared a waggon
load of oranges bowling and rolling about the area in the most
amusing manner possible.&nbsp; It was some time ere the nobles
could direct their attention to the unfortunate count of <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Tecklenburgh,
who, stunned by the blow given to him as the parting blessing of
the spiteful Dwarf, was lying insensible on the ground: the
moment he recovered, he declared his intention of pursuing the
enemy, in which he was seconded by all the knights present, who,
headed by Margaret as guide and commander, resolved to storm the
Orange Tree itself, and liberate the captive damsel.&nbsp; They
set forward with great courage and in good order; but they might
just as effectively have stayed at home, for, after wandering
about the forest for three days, they returned crestfallen
enough, not only being unable to discover the Orange Tree, but
even the plain in which it stood!&nbsp; Poor Ludolph, whom the
princes had vainly endeavoured to comfort with the assurance that
he had fairly gained the victory, though he had lost the fruit of
it, did not return with them.&nbsp; They lost him from their
company the first day of their search, and they firmly and
devoutly believed the yellow devil had hooked him also in his
infernal claws.&nbsp; Margaret gave herself up to grief, and her
sons, finding nothing else was to be done, endeavoured to forget
theirs in the bustle of the approaching war.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p>Ha!&mdash;such a pair!</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime Brunilda was
jogging on at no easy rate behind the Yellow Dwarf, who, when <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>arrived at
the Orange Tree, opened the trunk by a sign, and, dismounting,
bore his lovely burden into it.&nbsp; She felt herself,
immediately after, descending a flight of steps, which, from the
duration of time, appeared to be endless.&nbsp; They did
terminate, however, at last, and the Dwarf, placing her roughly
upon her feet, retired swiftly from the place, closing the
entrance at the bottom of the stairs carefully after him.&nbsp;
It was some time after his departure ere Brunilda took courage to
open her eyes and look around her; when she did, she found
herself in a subterraneous apartment as large as the bed-chamber
of the empress Constance. <a name="citation64"></a><a
href="#footnote64" class="citation">[64]</a>&nbsp; Every article
about it was of silver, and there was a magnificence about this
underground palace, which made her conclude it to be the castle
and principal residence of her intended husband, the Yellow
Dwarf, whose company she did not covet, and who, to do him
justice, did not appear to torment her.&nbsp; Food was supplied,
and every attention paid to her wishes by many attendants of both
sexes, who, however, never exchanged one single word in her
hearing.&nbsp; Wearied out by this continual taciturnity, she
began to wish for the sound of a human voice, and, thinking she
might probably learn something of the Dwarf&rsquo;s intentions
from himself, she one day instead of questioning her dumb
attendants as usual about her lover, demanded some tidings of
their master.&nbsp; &ldquo;He cannot approach your presence,
madam,&rdquo; replied one of the mutes, breaking his hateful
silence, &ldquo;unless you request his appearance.&nbsp; A mighty
spirit, one of the enemies of my master&rsquo;s and your
felicity, has contrived <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>this misfortune by his spells, but if
you command it, he is permitted to attend you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Brunilda, who, in giving this required permission, never dreamed
of any thing more than making inquiries after her family and
lover, was confounded to hear the Dwarf, with the most rapturous
impertinence, volubly thank her for this approval of his, and
generous acknowledgment of her passion.&nbsp; Putting aside his
long beard lest it should throw him down, he knelt fantastically
at her feet, seized her white hand, and declared himself the
happiest of all demon-born beings.&nbsp; It was in vain that
Brunilda reasoned, entreated, and scolded: he protested he was
satisfied with the proofs she had given of her love, and, in
order to spare her modesty the pain of appearing to yield too
soon, he should put a gentle restraint upon her liberty, and not
suffer her to quit his palace till she became his wife.&nbsp; At
this avowal the poor princess grew outrageous; she asked the
little monster how he had dared to select a princess of her
exalted rank to share his hole under ground, and burrow like rats
in the earth? why he had not rather chosen some humble cast-away
maiden, who, having nothing in the world to lose, might be
contented out of it?&nbsp; &ldquo;Rank!&rdquo; replied the
irritated little demon, &ldquo;and what is this rank of which you
are so vain?&nbsp; An imaginary splendour bestowed upon some men
by the cringing servility of others,&mdash;the weak fancy that
decks one with this supremacy, gives birth to the slavish fear
that ensures to him its possession.&nbsp; Rank!&rdquo; continued
the atrabilious little viper, swelling into a respectable width
by the overflowing of his angry venom, &ldquo;rank! it is power
gained by force, won by the sword, by fraud, by oppression!&nbsp;
The strongest is <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>the noblest; and if so I am more than your equal
beautiful Brunilda, for, princess as you are, you are my captive
and I am your master.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brunilda wept at this
insolence, and, like all who know not how to controvert what they
yet cannot bear to acknowledge, hated the Dwarf more than ever,
and resolved to prove it by seizing every opportunity of annoying
him.&nbsp; With laudable intention, she renewed the attack by
commenting with great severity upon his frightful little person:
she sneered at his long beard, short legs, and large head.&nbsp;
She demanded if he had ever looked in a mirror, and, if he had,
how he could presume to imagine he could captivate any woman
under such a detestable form?&nbsp; In no age have ugly people
borne to be laughed at, for, however hideous they may happen to
be, they seldom find it out themselves, and are in consequence,
very much surprised and offended when informed of it by others;
and, as vanity is usually the reigning passion of the most
disfigured, they seldom pardon an offence which is mortal.&nbsp;
The Dwarf, the ugliest animal the eyes of Brunilda had ever
encountered, could hardly believe this possible, and saw no joke
in her mirth at his expense, and, as he had his full share of
that precious commodity, vanity, he raved, stormed, and became so
insolent, that Brunilda was compelled to order him out of her
presence.&nbsp; This command, which he was obliged to obey,
irritated the little creature to madness, and he swore, that,
since he could not enter her presence without her permission, he
would find a mode of making her give it whenever he should
condescend to require it.&nbsp; This threat had more of truth in
it than Brunilda imagined.&nbsp; A few days after this animated
conversation, the Dwarf sent to ask leave to be allowed to pay
his visit to <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>the princess, which was immediately refused.&nbsp; This
threw him into a rage, and he informed the princess by one of his
mutes, &ldquo;that her lover Ludolph of Tecklenburgh was in his
power, and that his head should pay for the scorn with which she
thought proper to treat her lord and husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor
Brunilda hastily gave the required permission, upon condition
that Ludolph should accompany him; and her &ldquo;lord and
husband,&rdquo; as he styled himself entered, a few moments
after, followed by the knight, whom his demons had seized in the
forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, madam,&rdquo; said he, grinning like
Grimaldi, but not so merrily, &ldquo;I found this stranger in the
neighbourhood of my Orange Tree, and I have brought him hither to
secure a welcome for myself.&nbsp; Did I not tell you I would
make you glad to receive me?&nbsp; Here shall this valorous
knight remain, a hostage for your good behaviour; and never shall
you receive him without admitting me at the same
moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brunilda, who would have been delighted, in
her present condition, to have seen any human being whatever, was
in raptures at the sight of Ludolph, who, on his part, was
content with his captivity, since he shared it with her; and,
unrestrained by the presence of the Dwarf, they so often and so
tenderly repeated their mutual delight to each other, that the
grim jailer could not endure the sight of their happiness, and
rather than witness it, withdrew himself and Ludolph from the
company of Brunilda, which he did not again seek for some
time.&nbsp; When attended by Ludolph, he next entered her
apartment, his jealous tortures were increased by the renewed
endearments of the lovers, and resolving in his own mind not to
endure what he flattered himself he could easily <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>remedy, he
threw a spell over the unlucky Brunilda, which he generously
hoped would destroy all the little tranquillity she
enjoyed.&nbsp; The charm operated upon the sight of the princess,
who no longer beheld her lover, but a hideous negro advancing
towards her.&nbsp; Brunilda was terrified, but, reassured by the
explanation of the Dwarf, who felicitated himself on her
mortification, she resolved to punish him in kind; so collecting
all the woman in her soul, and conquering her dislike of the ugly
shape he presented to her, she gave it a most affectionate
welcome, and caressed it as her dear Ludolph.&nbsp; The Dwarf
would willingly have annihilated him; but obliged to keep him in
existence to ensure himself admittance to Brunilda, he resolved
to embitter that existence as much as lay in his power, and
having once more recourse to his spells, the handsome Ludolph,
unchanged to himself, appeared to the eyes of the fascinated
princess a furious and monstrous tiger, armed with tremendous
fangs and claws.&nbsp; But love penetrates all disguises, and the
princess was now a match for the sorcerer.&nbsp; She knew that
the fangs and claws, however terrible to others, had no danger
for her, and she suffered him to lie at her feet, kiss her snowy
hand, and put his shaggy head upon her lap, without manifesting
the slightest apprehension, to the great annoyance of the Dwarf,
whose dull wit was sharpened by his jealousy, and he now
contrived the master-piece of spells, to the increased misery of
poor Brunilda, over whose clouded senses the charm once more
operating, presented her beloved Ludolph only under the form of
the Yellow Dwarf himself.&nbsp; This transformation was horrible
to both the sufferers, for each of the figures maintained <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>that he was
the knight, and persisted in execrating the other as the
impostor, while Brunilda, wearied with gazing on their hateful
countenances, dared not afford the slightest notice to either,
lest she should bestow the tenderness designed for Ludolph upon
his detestable rival.&nbsp; In vain did she weep, threaten, and
supplicate the Dwarf to give her lover &ldquo;any shape but
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She knew not even to which of the pair she
ought to address her petition.&nbsp; But the demon was
inexorable, listened unmoved to her sorrows, for his heart was as
hard as Pharaoh&rsquo;s, and even inwardly laughed at her
agonies.&nbsp; In vain did she examine their features in the hope
of discovering some slight difference that might point out her
lover: both grinned the same ghastly smile,&mdash;both exhibited
the same unvarying ugliness of feature.&nbsp; Alas, poor
Brunilda!&nbsp; Lavater himself could not have assisted thee,
though, hadst thou lived in our days, or Dr. Spurzheim in thine,
some professional examination of the cerebral organisation of the
two dwarfs might have set the question at rest.&nbsp; Doubtless
some bump extraordinary, some wonderful dilation of the organ of
self-esteem in the skull of the true dwarf, or amativeness or
combativeness in that of the false one, might have aided thee to
discover the brutified soul confined in the brutified body.&nbsp;
But, as it was, they were both brutes to Brunilda, and, as she
had no wish to charm the Yellow Dwarf, she wept her
disappointment incessantly.&nbsp; Nor was Ludolph less busy than
the princess in employing threats and prayers by turns to mollify
the Dwarf, though one was to as little purpose as the other, in
the presence of the princess.&nbsp; The cunning demon reiterated
the same whining petition, used the <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>same arguments, and denounced the
same vengeance as the unhappy Ludolph; and when retired from her
apartment, laughed at his success, and defiance.&nbsp; It was in
vain that Ludolph accused him of having broken all the laws of
chivalry, held even by demons so sacred.&nbsp; He told him he
regarded no laws, except those which he had made himself.&nbsp;
It was to no purpose he argued his right to be set at liberty at
least.&nbsp; The Dwarf, who was a philosopher in his way, replied
that men had no rights, and that &ldquo;<i>might</i>,&rdquo;
which he possessed, was a much better argument, and a more
effective weapon.&nbsp; All this was unluckily true, but it did
not convince the Westphalian.&nbsp; Zeno, the stoic, said,
&ldquo;that we had two ears, and but one tongue, that we might
hear much and say little.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a wise observation,
and happy are those that profit thereby: our two captives might,
if they had had the good luck ever to have heard it; but as they
had not, they acted directly counter, for they so heartily used
their two tongues, and so entirely spared their four ears, that
their jailer grew outrageous, and therefore, except when he went
to torment Brunilda, he resolved to free himself from the society
of the count of Tecklenburgh, who paid for his garrulity by being
condemned to talk to himself in one of the most dreary dungeons
of the cavern.&nbsp; Here he had full leisure to think of his
misfortunes, and execrate the contriver of them.&nbsp; He prayed
night and morning with all the strength of lungs he could
command, to all the saints in the calendar, to give him a lift
out of this purgatory.&nbsp; He was too good a Christian not to
abhor all thought of magic; but, finding how little notice was
taken of his petition by the higher powers, <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>he could not
help thinking of the lower, and wishing and vowing, that if some
sorcerer, witch, or even devil, would but come to his assistance
now, he would find time enough for repentance hereafter, and heal
his conscience, and propitiate Heaven by many good deeds to be
done in perspective.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would walk to Jerusalem, for
a penance,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or give the spoils I shall take
in my next battle to the church, or I would, when I shall be
able, endow an abbey.&nbsp; Either of these designs would be
satisfactory,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;and oh that I had the
good luck to be able to put them into execution!&nbsp; Oh that
some friendly spirit, some gnome of these caverns, or demon of
this forest, would but come to my assistance!&rdquo;&nbsp; No
sooner said than done: the sinner trembled at the instant
fulfilment of his wicked wish, and began with real alarm to
suspect that he was a bit of a conjurer himself; for there arose
in a moment, from the bosom of the earth, a gigantic
dusky-looking figure in the human shape, inquiring his
commands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not come to your
assistance,&rdquo; said the object, &ldquo;till you summoned me,
or you should not have suffered so long.&nbsp; I am the mortal
foe of the Yellow Dwarf, and the legitimate prince of these
mines, into which he has intruded himself, during my absence on a
short journey I made to the centre.&nbsp; He has fixed himself
pretty firmly in my palace by his spells, but I shall contrive to
dispossess him.&nbsp; I will begin by assisting you; speak,
knight of Tecklenburgh, how can I serve you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ludolph, who, recovered from his first fright, desired nothing
better, immediately struck a bargain with the friendly gnome; the
first article of which was, that he should liberate himself and
the princess.&nbsp; <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;I can free you instantly,&rdquo; replied the
gnome, &ldquo;but the spells around the princess are too powerful
to be suddenly broken; nevertheless, with your help it may
finally be done.&nbsp; We must possess ourselves of the charm in
which lies the power of the Dwarf, this, unfortunately, is his
beard; for it will be a work of difficulty to master it.&nbsp;
Could you, in your combat, have cut off that, instead of his
head, all would have been well: but, as long as that beard hangs
to his chin, his body is invulnerable, for, cut him into fifty
pieces and he will unite together again.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
all these difficulties, observe faithfully all my directions,
and, ultimately we may accomplish our wishes.&nbsp; Beneath those
mountains of Bohemia which bound the marquisate of Misnia, there
is a diamond mine, as yet unknown to the human race, whose
sacrilegious hands have not there torn open the heart of their
mother earth and disturbed the spirits who sleep in her
bosom.&nbsp; There, concealed many fathoms beneath the mountain,
has been hidden for centuries the magic weapon which alone can
conquer the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; It is that identical pair of
scissors with which the demon Fate cuts asunder your mortal
destinies; these, and these only, can secure our enemy.&nbsp; It
will be in vain to cut off his head so long as he retains his
beard, and that beard is unapproachable, except to the magic
scissors of fate: the chief difficulty will be in obtaining
possession of this wonderful instrument, since only a knight of
unstained loyalty, pure, spotless, free from taint of
libertinism, drunkenness, and bloodshed, can take them from the
hands of the statue which holds them, without incurring the
severe penalty of instant death.&nbsp; When such a knight shall
be found, the <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>scissors must be put into the hands of a spotless
virgin, for only such can use them in cutting off the formidable
beard; should any other woman attempt it, the inevitable
consequences would be also death from the scissors
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Ludolph was as much depressed by
the end of this discourse as he had been elevated by the
beginning.&nbsp; Such a knight it was indeed next to impossible
to find.&nbsp; He himself was as good and true as most; his
loyalty was indeed unstained, he had not shed blood in murderous
or treacherous manner; but he had been too frequently engaged in
his father&rsquo;s petty, and often unjustifiable wars, to
undertake an enterprise that demanded hands free from
stain.&nbsp; Then as to drunkenness, alas! for poor Ludolph,
though naturally a very sober man, he knew he had too often
shared many a &ldquo;t&rsquo;other flask,&rdquo; and too
frequently drowned his fears of the abbot of Fulda in the big
bowl of Tecklenburgh, to permit him any chance of success in the
achievement.&nbsp; In his own person, therefore, he gave it
directly up, satisfied of his incapacity from the fore-mentioned
weaknesses, without carrying his self-examination any further,
but at the same time almost despairing of finding a
substitute.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the spotless virgin, friendly
gnome,&rdquo; said the honest Westphalian, &ldquo;there I have
better hopes, since there are enough at court, and I shall find
this part of my task easy enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not quite
so easy as you imagine, knight,&rdquo; replied the gnome,
&ldquo;since there is not an unmarried lady in all Thuringia who
will not lay claim to that honour, and you may thus be the
innocent cause of the death of many; but I can assist you here,
and make this part of the undertaking much less difficult.&nbsp;
Here is a magic girdle; obtain permission to try it, without <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>speaking of
its virtues, upon the ladies of the margrave&rsquo;s court.&nbsp;
Should the dame who should buckle it on be a deceiver, the girdle
though now appearing of large size, will shrink into the smallest
compass, and will not even encircle her slender waist: should the
lady be the object of your search, it will set closely and
gracefully to her form.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A thousand
thanks,&rdquo; replied the honest knight; &ldquo;I have no fears
for my success in this point, and perhaps I may be more fortunate
than I expect in the other.&nbsp; Now then, generous friend,
accomplish your kind intention, release me from this dungeon, and
I will immediately hasten to Eisenac and seek a maiden who may
assist to break these abominable enchantments.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied the spirit, &ldquo;but do not
forget that to other eyes as well as Brunilda&rsquo;s, you still
wear the form of the Yellow Dwarf; this is occasioned by three
orange-coloured hairs, from his formidable beard, tied round your
right arm; unloose them, and you will appear to others as you do
to yourself and me.&nbsp; Be under no alarm for the safety of the
princess, since I have already prevented your enemy&rsquo;s
entering her presence without her permission, and will still
continue to watch over her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The knight again thanked
the gnome for his friendly care, and shutting his eyes, by
command of his companion, and opening them again the next
instant, found himself, to his infinite joy, standing near the
Orange Tree, round which his horse was quietly grazing.&nbsp; He
soon sprang lightly into his saddle, and turned his head from the
wood, determined to reach Eisenac ere daybreak.&nbsp; With this
resolution he spurred on gaily, thinking of the joy he should
feel upon liberating his beloved Brunilda, when, in a turn of the
wood, he suddenly encountered <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>a troop of knights in the livery of
the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; A cold shivering seized him, for he
expected to be dragged back neck and heels to the Orange Tree,
when, to his utter astonishment, they all lowly saluted and made
way for him to pass.&nbsp; He now remembered that he had not yet
removed the orange-coloured hairs from his arm, and, feeling
himself indebted to this circumstance, for his safety resolved to
let them remain till he should be quite out of the infernal
forest.&nbsp; Dwelling fondly upon his hopes and brightening
prospects, the young morning sun found him entering Eisenac,
where he was greeted with a loud shout by a troop of boys, who
seemed to recognise an old acquaintance.&nbsp; Soon the boy crowd
was augmented by a multitude of citizens, who surrounded Ludolph,
yelling like fiends, seized his bridle, pinioned his arms, and
saluted him with a dreadful volley of curses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sorcerer, robber, demon!&rdquo; rung in his ears in all
directions, and, while the uproar raged in its greatest violence,
he was dragged from his horse, and thrown on the ground.&nbsp; At
this extraordinary treatment, the count demanded to be conducted
to the margrave, to the princess Margaret.&nbsp; He was told that
the court had quitted Eisenac, but they were resolved to burn him
alive in revenge for his treatment of their beloved princess, and
the noble count Ludolph, her destined husband.&nbsp; Solomon
said, that &ldquo;fear is nothing else than a betraying the
succours which reason offereth;&rdquo; and, in this case, it was
most truly so, for the knight&rsquo;s agitation in the first part
of the attack, had made him forget in time to remove the
orange-coloured hairs from his arm.&nbsp; Their last exclamation
had shewn him their mistake, and his own fatal imprudence.&nbsp;
Now he found that he was in danger of being <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>burnt alive
for the sins of the execrable Dwarf, unless he could immediately
free himself from the charm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear me, dear
friends,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I am truly the unhappy Ludolph,
but your eyes are bewitched by the sorceries of that abominable
demon, and you see me only under his resemblance; release my arms
for one moment, and I will convince you.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this
insult to their understandings, the wise men of Eisenac set up a
most tremendous howl, and were still more anxious to collect
faggots for his service.&nbsp; They kicked, buffeted, and reviled
his person till he was almost delirious with rage, and the
foamings of his indignation confirmed them in their belief that
he really was, what he appeared, the demon of the Orange
Tree.&nbsp; During one of the pauses made by his guards to listen
to his earnest entreaties for a moment&rsquo;s liberty, he found
means to disengage his hands from their grasp, tore open his
sleeve, and furiously rending away the slight bandage of hair,
stood before them in his own proper person.&nbsp; Astonishment
for a moment tied up the tongues of the assembly, but quickly
recovering themselves before Ludolph could gain time to explain,
they declared it a new piece of sorcery, and swore that the form
of their gallant favourite should not shield the wizard who they
firmly believed was his murderer.&nbsp; The magistrates and
officers of Eisenac, aroused by the news of the seizure of the
demon Dwarf, had assembled upon the spot, and startled by the
wonders they now heard, trembled to think of the consequences of
the unbridled fury of the mob, should the story told by the
equivocal knight be really true.&nbsp; Anxious to avoid the
spilling of innocent blood, they proposed conveying him to <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>prison, and
awaiting the decision of the margrave; but the people anticipated
a sight, and rather than lose so excellent a joke as that of
roasting a sorcerer, they would willingly have run the hazard of
sacrificing even Ludolph himself.&nbsp; But the magistrates, much
to their honour, continued firm, and, through their interference,
poor Ludolph, who already felt the flames crackling under him,
with much difficulty obtained permission to say a few words to
them in defence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Noble magistrates and discerning
judges,&rdquo; said the mob-hunted count of Tecklenburgh,
&ldquo;I trust that you will believe that I am really myself as I
declare to you by my knighthood I am.&nbsp; As for the Yellow
Dwarf, a curse on him, I am his victim, not his ally; since it is
from his infernal enchantments, and still more infernal malice,
all my misfortunes have arisen.&nbsp; How you can for a moment
imagine that I could be his friend because I have been unlucky
enough to appear under his odious form, I am at a loss to
imagine, since nobody surely can possibly believe such a
transformation to be a matter of choice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The female
part of the audience perfectly agreed with the last observation
of Ludolph, and the magistrates, puzzled by the sincerity with
which he had delivered his remonstrance, determined to save him,
at least from the fire and the faggots.&nbsp; But, as the people
had expected a show, thought the wise men of Eisenac, &ldquo;a
show they must have,&rdquo; or the consequences, they knew, of
their disappointment in an affair so essential to their
well-being, might not be entirely insignificant to their
betters.&nbsp; So, while acquitting him, in their consciences, of
being the Yellow Dwarf, and forbidding the animating use of fire
and faggots, they condemned <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>him to be put to the ban, as a
nobleman, for dabbling in a little private sorcery in conjunction
with the demon, in whose villainous shape he had just
appeared.&nbsp; No sooner was this righteous sentence pronounced
against the unlucky Ludolph, than he was seized by the soldiers
and followed by all the crowd, who, anxious to join in the fun,
exhibited many a practical witticism at his expense, and cracked
all their superfluous jokes upon his unfortunate person: then
stripping him of his armour and knightly accoutrements, and
clothing him in raw and filthy goatskins, they set him upon a
sorry mule with his face toward the tail, and led him through the
town, the herald proclaiming before him, &ldquo;We declare thy
wife, if thou hast one, a widow, thy children, if thou hast any,
orphans, and we send thee, in the name of the devil, to the four
corners of the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus sent upon a long voyage,
with such a friendly benediction, it would not have been
wonderful if the heart of the knight had sunk with his
circumstances, which any heart would have done except a
Westphalian one, but that was employed in swelling with
indignation, and meditating the best mode of returning the
compliments of the Eisenac mobility.&nbsp; While thus occupied,
he heard a voice close to his ear, which whispered, &ldquo;Attend
to my orders, and you are safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked earnestly
in the direction of the sound, and saw, to his infinite
satisfaction, the dusky face of his friend the gnome beneath the
helmet of a soldier.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let these people continue to
believe you the Yellow Dwarf,&rdquo; continued the spirit;
&ldquo;it is the only way to preserve you from suspicion in your
real character; here are the hairs which, in your haste, you
threw away.&nbsp; <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Resist not while I tie them round your arm, and leave
the rest to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ludolph sat silent while, under the
appearance of a new insult, his instructor twisted the light band
round his arm, and the shrieks of the people a moment after
announced that the charm had taken effect upon their
senses.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the sorcerer,&rdquo; they cried,
&ldquo;the horrible Dwarf&mdash;seize him, tear him, burn
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; But, for this time, their kind intentions were
completely frustrated, for the gnome, entering into the sorry
mule which carried the prisoner, communicated to his worn-out
frame such inconceivable vigour and rapidity, that a few minutes
were sufficient to bear his rider far beyond the pursuit of his
enemies, who remained in the market-place, staring after the
beast and cursing the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; The representative of
that malignant little demon was meanwhile receiving a few drops
of a powerful cordial from the hand of his friend the gnome of
the mine, who politely apologised for not knowing earlier the
mischiefs into which his dear crony had fallen,&mdash;owing,
however, entirely to his own excessive carelessness, which he
should never have suspected.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, in truth,&rdquo;
continued the friendly spirit, &ldquo;I concluded you were safe
at the margrave&rsquo;s court which is at Weimar, and whither I
had intended to follow you.&nbsp; Passing over Eisenac, I rested
to know the meaning of the tumult I witnessed, and was just in
time to rescue you from the rage of the mob, who would not have
quitted their prey, even after the soldiers should have set you
at liberty.&nbsp; Here,&rdquo; continued the gnome, giving him a
heavy bag of coin, a most welcome present to a half-naked knight
errant, &ldquo;hasten to equip yourself according to your rank,
and lose no <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>time in joining the court at Weimar, where you must
select a damsel to conclude the adventure ere Brunilda can
recover her liberty, or you be freed from the malice of the
Yellow Dwarf.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ludolph heartily thanked his good
friend, though he could not help thinking it would have been as
well if his assistance had been tendered some few hours
earlier.&nbsp; But still, better late than never, thought the
knight; and, though he received a few cuffs and many bitter
curses, yet hard words break no bones, and the cuffs he hoped one
day to repay with interest.&nbsp; In the interim his honour was
preserved by the contrivance of the gnome, as no man in Eisenac,
no, not even the sapient magistrates themselves, would ever
believe the creature they had pounded and worried so
unmercifully, was any other than the Yellow Dwarf himself.&nbsp;
Receiving from his hands once more the magic girdle which he had
lost in the confusion, he bade farewell to the gnome, who
promised to meet him in the forest, when he should have obtained
the magic scissors, upon which their success depended; and after
accoutring himself as became his condition, not this time
forgetting the three red hairs, he set forward once more for the
court of the margrave; and, he was by no means of a melancholy
complexion, his past misfortunes had no other effect upon his
spirits than elevating them to a joyous pitch for glee, that he
had so well escaped the dangers which he believed would have
ended more tragically.&nbsp; And thus gay, and hoping much from
the future, he arrived, without any further adventure, at the
palace of Weimar.</p>
<h3><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Ane gat a twist o&rsquo; the craig,<br />
Ane gat a bunch o&rsquo; the wame,<br />
Anither gat lam&rsquo;d o&rsquo; a leg,<br />
And syne he went bellowing hame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> princess Margaret was overjoyed
once more to see her Brunilda&rsquo;s lover, and she welcomed him
with the sincerest regard.&nbsp; She listened with burning
indignation to the account of the Dwarf&rsquo;s treatment of his
captives, and to such other parts of his history as he thought
proper to relate; for he carefully suppressed, in the presence of
the court, his adventures at Eisenac and his release by the
gnome, lest the friendship of this good-natured spirit should
again subject him to the charge of sorcery; and as he had already
smelt fire at Eisenac, he was particularly anxious to avoid so
warm a reception elsewhere.&nbsp; He informed the good princess
that the girdle would only fit the damsel appointed by destiny to
break the enchantment, and of consequence all were anxious to try
it.&nbsp; Three of the most beautiful ladies in Misnia attempted,
but strange to relate, in vain, to fix on the magic cestus: it
shrunk to nothing round their forms, and Ludolph began again to
tremble for the fate of his poor Brunilda.&nbsp; In vain did the
most prudish ladies of the court present their slim forms to the
girdle,&mdash;it would not meet around them.&nbsp; Several of
those who had been most rigid in their own conduct, and most
bitterly virtuous in regard to that of others, took the girdle
with a devout air and blushing modesty, that quite revived the
hope of the Westphalian knight.&nbsp; Alas! the cestus not only
refused to clasp the waists of these <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>fair ones, but even flew right out of
their hands the moment they touched it; and this circumstance so
disheartened Ludolph, that he foolishly enough, ere above twenty
ladies had made the attempt, gossiped out the secret of its
virtues in the delighted ear of the princess Margaret.&nbsp; That
good lady thought the joke too excellent to be confined to so few
persons; and there being among the unlucky twenty some whose
beauty rivalled that of her beloved Brunilda, she lost no time in
publishing the secret, which had the effect of making them all
abhor Ludolph, and defeating the plans he was so anxious to carry
into effect; for now, not a single woman acquainted with the
virtue of the cestus would even try it on, and, instead of
laughing with the princess and Ludolph at the unlucky discovery
made by the twenty, they made, much to their honour, common cause
against them, and vowed to smother the mischievous knight
whenever they could conveniently catch hold of him.&nbsp; It
required all the authority of the margrave, who at this juncture
arrived at Weimar from the camp, to protect the unfortunate
knight from their vengeance, who began to be as much afraid of
these beautiful destroying angels as he had been of the
fire-loving devils of Eisenac, or even the Yellow Dwarf
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I am surely the most
unfortunate of men,&rdquo; said he to the margrave; &ldquo;I have
been transformed to the detested shape of the Yellow Dwarf, for
wishing to deliver your sister out of his hands.&nbsp; I have
been near roasted alive for killing myself.&nbsp; I have been put
to the ban for suffering myself to be tormented by my powerful
enemy, and now I am in danger of being torn to pieces by the
loveliest women in the world, only for being anxious to find one
virgin in their company.&nbsp; Ah, my <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>poor Brunilda! what will become of
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; The margrave comforted the knight with the
assurance that he would certainly be successful, if he could but
prevail upon the ladies only to try on the girdle, and, in case
of their obstinacy, he advised him to put the magic scissors into
the hands of Brunilda herself, &ldquo;For, if she be not worthy
to use them,&rdquo; said the proud Frederic with the bitten
cheek, &ldquo;she is not worthy of liberty, nor the tender love
you bear her.&nbsp; For the other conditions, I fear we must
despair, since I do believe there is not a knight in my court, no
not in all the courts of Germany, that will accept the challenge;
though against mortal foes, they are the bravest men in the
universe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The margrave was right.&nbsp; Each knight
knew his own secret weakness too well to accept the office, when
the conditions were stated to them, no one being willing, as they
honestly avowed, to hazard an ignominious death, by disregarding
the injunctions of the gnome.&nbsp; There was not a man among
them who had not, at some time or other, offended by drunkenness,
licentiousness, or breaking heads in an unjust quarrel: indeed,
with regard to the latter peccadillo: it was scarcely possible,
in the time of which I am treating, for it to be otherwise, since
not only disputes of chivalry, and all injuries, whether public
or private, were settled by the sword, even cases of felony and
suits of law were arranged by the same expeditious decision; so
that he of the strongest arm and stoutest heart infallibly gained
his cause, whether right or wrong, as his adversary could no
longer contend, either for reputation or property, after the
dagger of mercy had been struck into his heart, or drawn quietly
across his throat.</p>
<p>But, to return to our good Westphalian and his <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>difficulties.&nbsp; After many objections, disputings,
hopings, and fearings, the margrave at last found a salvo for
Ludolph, and a stainless knight for the service of the king of
the oranges.&nbsp; This was his own son, a boy of ten years old,
upon whom, finding all other hope fail, he conferred the honour
of knighthood, and released him from his martial studies, in
which the gallant child spent all his time, and sent him to
handle the shears of Atropus, and share in the glory of shaving
the orange-coloured beard of the execrable Dwarf.&nbsp; The
little knight Herman of Misnia was highly delighted by his
admittance to this post of honour, and attached himself fondly to
his good cousin Ludolph, who now began making preparations for
his march.&nbsp; So great was the terror inspired among the
people by the Yellow Dwarf, that it was with much difficulty he
could collect troops sufficient to defend the son of the margrave
upon this voyage of discovery, as all the nobles, knights, and
regulars of Thuringia, were gone to the camp in daily expectation
of an attack from the emperor Albert, who, having just been
overreached in his views upon Bohemia, by his good cousin Henry
of Carinthia, was advancing in no good humour upon the troops of
the margrave of Misnia.&nbsp; After a proclamation of some days,
in which Ludolph puffed the vast riches of the diamond mine with
almost as much skill as Day and Martin puff their blacking, a
number of strays from all parts of the empire gathered themselves
together under his standard; and though he could not boast of
commanding many of the nobles of Misnia, yet upon the whole, his
troop was about as respectable as David&rsquo;s at the cave of
Adullam, when only those who were in debt, or distress, or
discontented, enrolled themselves <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>in his service.&nbsp; But great
endings spring from small beginnings.&nbsp; From the captain of
half-starved ragamuffins David became a king; and Ludolph hoped
that his regiment of black-guards would finally conduct him to
the feet of a princess.&nbsp; With this notion he set forward,
full of expectation, with the youthful knight committed to his
charge.&nbsp; On the road, fearful of any other delays, he
inspired his companions by dwelling, with affected rapture, upon
the spoils of the diamonds, which were so soon to be at their
service, in the sack of the mine.&nbsp; These observations acted
like electricity upon his respectable warriors, and sent them
galloping toward the confines so rapidly, that before he had
either hoped or expected it, they had arrived at the foot of the
mystic mountain, where the whole troop made a halt, to await the
return of Ludolph, who, with his young companion, was to descend
first into the caves, seize the scissors, and then leave the
coast clear for the plunderers to attack the mine.&nbsp; Matters
were soon settled.&nbsp; The two knights found the entrance with
some difficulty, and boldly descended into these dismal abodes,
the residence of the infernal spirits who were in the pay of the
Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; After traversing many dreary caverns, they
entered the last, where, elevated on a golden pedestal, stood the
gigantic statue which held the scissors of fate, and was the
guardian of the life of the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; Forgetting, in
his joy at the sight, the caution of the gnome, he was advancing
towards the statue, when a tremendous box on the ear from the
marble fist, taught him to know his distance.&nbsp; He fell back
accordingly, and, young Herman of Misnia approaching, the statue
grinned as hideously at his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, but made no <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>attempt to
injure the boy, as fearlessly he climbed the pedestal, and,
without any regard to the rights of property, grasped the magic
scissors, and brought them back in triumph.&nbsp; Ludolph
received them from his hands with the wildest sensation of
delight; but, prudence conquering his emotions, he took his young
preserver in his arms and retraced his way to daylight.&nbsp;
Here he was greeted with shouts of applause by the soldiers, who,
in spite of all the entreaties of Ludolph, persisted to ransack
the caves, pursuant to their original agreement.&nbsp; In vain
did he assure them the margrave&rsquo;s enemies would furnish
more spoils for them than the vaults, and that his share should
be divided among them.&nbsp; Vainly did he describe the
threatening looks of the statue, and assure them he still felt
the tingling of the marble thump in his ear, with which he had
complimented him.&nbsp; It was talking to the winds, or, as old
Baker quaintly saith, &ldquo;to as little purpose as if he had
gone about to call back yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; Down they all
dashed together, neck and heels, with tremendous outcries, into
the diamond caverns.&nbsp; Their return was silent and orderly
enough.&nbsp; The cave of Trophonius could not have effected a
better or more expeditious change.&nbsp; They were all as grave
as judges, and every man appeared with his mouth twisted exactly
under his left ear.&nbsp; Ludolph could gain but little
information as to what had befallen them; all he understood was,
that they had seen the statue, who had given the first man such a
thundering slap of the face that its shock was felt by all the
rest of his companions, and left the consequences which he now
beheld, and which they had such good reasons to deplore.&nbsp; <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>But, while
the knights of the scissors and their wry-mouthed confederates
are pursuing their road to Weimar, let us pop our heads under
ground and see what has become of Brunilda.</p>
<p>The poor princess, much disconcerted by the diabolical
contrivance of the Yellow Dwarf, gave way, when alone, to that
indulgence of grief which she resolutely suppressed in his
presence.&nbsp; She had encouraged the visits of the two Dwarfs,
in the tender hope that, though they afforded no consolation to
herself, they might yield some satisfaction to the bosom of her
tormented lover.&nbsp; This being the real state of her feelings,
she was deeply distressed when, the day after Ludolph&rsquo;s
release by the gnome, they neglected to pay her the customary
visit, and therefore sent to request the presence of her
tyrant.&nbsp; He came, and in no very good humour, for he had
just failed in the effect of a spell, which he hoped would
discover the runaway.&nbsp; He told her, even more brutally than
usual, that Ludolph had escaped, that he was endeavouring to
discover him, and that in case he succeeded, of which he had no
doubt, he would immediately hang him, unless the princess would
save his life by giving her hand to his rival.&nbsp; Delighted by
the escape of the knight, Brunilda could not keep her joy to
herself, but expressed it so imprudently, and with such heartfelt
glee at the Dwarf&rsquo;s vexation, that it irritated all the
bile in his little yellow body, and provoked him to have recourse
to his most powerful spells to discover the abode of
Ludolph.&nbsp; It was, luckily for the knight, a work of time and
difficulty, since the gnome of the mine was at hand to unravel
all his charms as fast as the other wrought them; and he was, by
this means, obliged to desist, in order <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>to find the
invisible enemy who thus thwarted his plans and protected his
victim.&nbsp; The indefatigable gnome was still at his elbow, and
poor yellow-beard continued as much in the dark at the end of his
spells, as he had been at the beginning.&nbsp; All this gave the
knight time, which was what the gnome wanted, and the Dwarf
remained in ignorance of his movements, till the spirits, who
were the guardians of his talisman in the mountain caves,
informed him of his danger and the seizure of the magic
scissors.&nbsp; Such a contrivance as that of knighting a child
the demon never contemplated, but finding one half of the
adventure accomplished, he determined, as far as in him lay, to
prevent the achievement of the other.&nbsp; Learning by his
fiends, that he was threatened with danger from Brunilda, he made
it his principal care that the magic scissors should not be
wielded by her, and accordingly penned her up more closely than
ever, surrounding her by spells, not only inaccessible to
mortals, but even to his own attendant spirits, whom he would not
trust too far, lest his tyranny should have inspired them with
hatred to his person, and laxity in his service.&nbsp; Among his
equals in the demon world he well knew, and feared the
indignation of the gnome of the silver mines, whose territories
he had invaded, and before whose power, if joined to that of
other enemies, he would have good reasons to tremble.&nbsp; These
considerations determined his conduct, and, to prevent Brunilda
from handling the scissors, and the scissors from approaching his
beard, he devised a spell so potent, that he fondly hoped and
believed he was safe from the attacks of, and might bid defiance
to, all sorts of enemies, natural and supernatural.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Ludolph and his companions <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>had arrived
at the court of Weimar, to the great joy of the margrave and his
mother, who, looking upon the adventure as nearly finished,
entreated Ludolph to lose no time in joining his friend the gnome
in the enchanted forest.&nbsp; He himself had no wish to delay
the business, and, after making one more unsuccessful attempt to
prevail upon the ladies of Misnia to try on the girdle, he set
off to present it to his lovely Brunilda: and, arriving near the
Orange Tree, was met by the friendly gnome.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
not yet in my power to introduce you to the presence of the
princess,&rdquo; said he to the count, &ldquo;as I have not yet
conquered the spells by which our enemy has surrounded her: the
cavern is inaccessible at present to any human foot, but it is
not in the power of the demon to limit my steps in the territory
of which I am the legitimate lord.&nbsp; His spirits are as
powerful as mine, and thus I am obliged to have recourse to
artifice to conquer him, which I should not be able to effect, if
he had not, by obtruding into my dominions, placed the secret in
my power.&nbsp; Unlike the free spirits who have existed from the
beginning of the world, and who will probably survive its
demolition, the Dwarf is mortal born, though, by magic spells, he
has lengthened his life many hundred years; but his birth
subjects him to death, which will be inevitable, should the
infernal power by which he has accomplished his purposes be
defeated.&nbsp; To prevent this catastrophe, he has placed his
life in a talisman, which he believes unconquerable, but which, I
trust, we shall overthrow.&nbsp; Caution is, however, necessary,
for his spells are mighty, and the spirits subjected to his
command are many.&nbsp; In the interim you shall rest here, and I
will provide for your necessities <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>till I shall be able to conduct you
to Brunilda, to whom you must explain the virtues of the scissors
of fate, for, by an immutable decree which no spirit dares
violate, I am restrained from appearing before her till she
herself shall summon me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gnome then raised a
comfortable tent for Ludolph, loaded it with provisions, drew a
line of protection about it, and vanished.</p>
<p>Three days passed tranquilly enough with Ludolph, while
patiently awaiting the re-appearance of his friend the gnome, but
the fourth was beginning to hang heavy, when the spirit entered
the tent in the middle of the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
triumph,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have unloosed the spell that
kept you from the presence of Brunilda.&nbsp; The Dwarf, being
mortal born, is subject to mortal necessities, and at this hour
he sleeps; rise and throw yourself at the feet of the princess;
give me your hand, and close your eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ludolph
obeyed, and the next moment found himself in the apartment of
Brunilda.&nbsp; As I, the honest chronicler of the loves of the
Westphalian knight and Misnian princess, am no great dealer in
sentiment, I shall omit all the particulars of the meeting, and
only say how truly happy Brunilda was to receive him, and how
grateful she felt towards the obliging gnome, whom she gladly
summoned to her presence.&nbsp; To the great relief of Ludolph,
who trembled and doubted grievously while making the proposal,
she had not the slightest objection, even after she was made
acquainted with its virtues, to try on the enchanted girdle,
which fitted her graceful form as if it had been purposely made
for her: her lover could not help commending the taste of the
Yellow Dwarf, and was as much overjoyed at this earnest of
success as if he held the demon&rsquo;s <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>beard in his
hand.&nbsp; The gnome then gave Brunilda the fatal scissors, and
telling them that the spirits of their enemy could not perceive
them, from the powerful spells by which they are surrounded,
desired them to follow his footsteps fearlessly to the inner
caverns, where slept the demon, and whom sleep would probably
render defenceless.&nbsp; Stretching out their necks and stepping
on tiptoe, the lovers followed the gnome to the private apartment
of the Dwarf, whom Brunilda anxiously hoped to serve in quality
of barber extraordinary.&nbsp; With beating hearts they beheld
their guide throw open the door of his chamber, and desire the
princess to advance, at the same time approaching the couch of
the demon, and drawing back his curtain.&nbsp; Brunilda obeyed;
mustering all her courage, and collecting a little army of
disagreeable remembrances to her aid, she found herself so
strengthened that, like Judith, she resolved to finish the
business with a single snip.&nbsp; But the Holofernes of Germany
had had more wit than his drunken predecessor, and had taken much
better care of his shaggy head; for the Judith of Misnia looked
in vain for the yellow beard that was to fall beneath the fatal
scissors.&nbsp; That <i>that</i> had disappeared was not
wonderful, since the face to which it formed such a remarkable
appendage had entirely vanished from the body.&nbsp; There lay
the carcase of the Dwarf, sleeping, it may be, but his head was
dozing in some other place, for the body was very quietly
reposing without it.&nbsp; Poor Brunilda shed tears of vexation,
and the gnome looked silly enough to find himself thus completely
outwitted; but knowing that he could find no remedy for the
disappointment by standing gaping at the <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>demon&rsquo;s
trunk, he drew the lovers from the chamber, conducted Ludolph
back to his tent, and again had recourse to his spells, which
told him that the Dwarf, fearful of surprise while disarmed by
sleep, took off his head every night, and concealed it in some
place of safety, but where he could not discover.&nbsp; This was
a vexatious incident; but &ldquo;<i>ruse contre ruse</i>,&rdquo;
thought the gnome, and to work he went with a fresh resolution to
outspell the yellow conjuror and liberate the lovers.&nbsp; In
the mean time the demon awoke from his invigorating slumber, and
hastened to replace his ugly head upon his shoulders, and then,
head and tail once more united, sat down to consider the
possibility of recapturing the knight of Tecklenburgh, in whose
hands, notwithstanding the success of his spells, he did not like
to leave the magic scissors.&nbsp; Brunilda, it is true, was safe
enough; but the Dwarf knew (though Ludolph could not discover
them) that there were more virgins than one in the Misnian court;
and that the count wanted neither eloquence to persuade such to
assist him, nor resolution to attack his enemy, when that
difficulty should be conquered.&nbsp; In the midst of these
cogitations he was aroused by a summons from the princess, who
had not permitted him to approach her since the day after
Ludolph&rsquo;s departure: the little coxcomb was enchanted by
the message, and hastened to arrange his look in the most
becoming manner possible, ere he presented himself before the
eyes of his lovely captive.&nbsp; Brunilda was in tears when he
entered her apartment, and no sooner did she behold him than she
poured upon him such a torrent of reproach and abuse, that the
Dwarf, though in general tolerably well skilled in the use of
that cutting weapon the <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>tongue, stood utterly confounded, and
knew not what to reply.&nbsp; She accused him vehemently of the
murder of her lover, her dear Ludolph, which secret she said, had
been revealed to her in a dream by her patron saint that very
night, and she had therefore sent to him to accuse him to his
guilty face.&nbsp; The Dwarf listened in surprise; but this time
far from retorting with the usual bitterness upon Brunilda, he
was hugging himself in the notion that the patron saint might
have told the truth, and that Ludolph, whom all his arts had
failed to discover, might really be no longer an inhabitant of
the earth, in which case he flattered himself he might possibly
succeed him in the affections of the fair Brunilda, whose hand he
coveted no less than her brother&rsquo;s lands, of which he
resolved to dispossess him whenever he should become the husband
of his sister.&nbsp; Full of these agreeable hopes and ideas, he
soothed the weeping princess as well as the ruggedness of his
nature would permit, and assured her, that though her lover was
dead, (a circumstance of which he averred he was well aware,
though compassion had hitherto prevented his informing her,) yet
he had no hand in his death, and would endeavour by every mark of
tenderness and attention to reconcile her to this inevitable
loss.&nbsp; Brunilda suffered herself to be comforted, and even
allowed his yellow lips to press her fair hand, which so
delighted the lover, that he released her from her severe
confinement, and permitted her to roam at large through the
caverns, and occupy her former apartment, where he continued to
visit her daily, and daily quitted her with the flattering hope
that he had at length discovered the mode of making himself
agreeable.&nbsp; Brunilda encouraged <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>this delightful dream by her changed
method of conduct; she ceased, after the first two interviews,
entirely to reproach the Dwarf, and permitting his devotions, she
gradually appeared to desire them, and even frequently
condescended to rally him upon the oddity of his dress, and the
old-fashioned cut of his hood: he immediately adopted another to
gratify her taste, and was exceedingly vain of the notice she
took of him.&nbsp; She admired his flowing hair, and even his
long beard had ceased to be an object of disgust to her: every
thing became beautiful by custom, she said; and she now
discovered, what her indignation before had prevented her from
observing, that the colour of his beard was the same as that of
her great grandfather the emperor Frederic II., who was
universally accounted a very handsome man.&nbsp; The Dwarf
smirked, bridled, and was equally delighted with Brunilda and
himself, since he now hoped no further opposition on her part
would be offered to his proposals: he grew excessively fond of,
and very indulgent to the princess, suffering her to command in
his caverns, and taking great delight in exhibiting to her the
riches of which she was so soon to be mistress.&nbsp; In all
ages, among all nations, flattery has ever been the shortest and
surest road to the human heart; and men, however they may affect
to smile at this weakness in the gentler sex, are not, whether
giants, middle-sized men, or dwarfs, one whit less subject to
this poor human frailty than the ladies themselves, in whom it is
so pardonable.</p>
<p>If Eve yielded to the compliments of the serpent, Sampson was
subdued by the witching coaxing of Delilah; the sage Solomon
drank flattery from the <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>lips of seven hundred wives (Heaven
pardon the old monopoliser!) and concubines; Holofernes lost his
head for listening to the seducing tongue of Judith; and the
mighty Nebuchadnezzar was not sent to grass for any other reason
than swallowing down too plentiful a dose of this bewitching
opiate: of all these gentlefolks, Eve was certainly least
blameable; for it required diabolical power to turn her from the
path of right, but the men sunk their virtue before the lustre of
black eyes or the gorgeousness of costly attire.&nbsp; As for
profane story&mdash;O the tens and the fifties that might be
enumerated!&mdash;but as this is not our present business, let us
leave them to see what effect this pleasant medicine, so gently
administered, had upon the little Dwarf.&nbsp; He was, in truth,
the happiest of all yellow men; for, deceived by the tranquillity
of his life and the strength of his spells, he believed his enemy
had given up the task of conquering him, and left him to wear his
beard in quiet.&nbsp; Brunilda still continued amiable, and heard
him frequently, without any marks of indignation, express his
hope that, when the time of her sorrowful mourning for the count
of Tecklenburgh should be over, she would listen with compassion
to a truer lover.&nbsp; She neither checked nor encouraged these
expectations; and the happy demon determined not to forfeit her
affections by any precipitation on his part.&nbsp; All this
amiable conduct, however, on the part of Brunilda, was in fact
but a contrivance of the friendly gnome, who thus hoped to extort
by her means the secret of his nightly pillow from himself.&nbsp;
According to the plan agreed upon by the allies, the gnome, at
this period of his enemy&rsquo;s courtship, began again to
disturb and puzzle him by his enchantments; and he <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>succeeded in
discomposing the harmony of his feelings so much, that he was
obliged to have recourse to Brunilda, and (secure of her
attachment to his person) vent all his complaints and vexations
in her compassionating bosom.&nbsp; <i>She</i> was all
astonishment at the cruel designs projected against her Dwarf by
his ungenerous enemies; she implored him pathetically to take
care of his head, (a request with which he graciously promised to
comply, more for her sake than his own,) and exhibited such
anxiety to know if his precautions were sufficient, that the
Dwarf almost betrayed his secret, overcome by the excessive
vanity her conduct was so well calculated to inspire.&nbsp;
Relaxing from his habitual caution, he was about to inform her of
some arrangements of his spells, when Brunilda, overacting the
part assigned to her, entreated him, if he valued her happiness,
to commit his precious head every night to her keeping, promising
to guard it with the utmost tenderness and care.&nbsp; At this
imprudent request, all his suspicions returned; he eyed Brunilda
askance, and gravely told her that, even were she his bride, he
could not grant her desire, as it had always been his opinion
that the less wives were trusted with the care of their
husbands&rsquo; heads the better.&nbsp; He left her surlily: he
had himself told her of his headless rest, but he did not expect
such a request would follow his information; and Brunilda,
alarmed by the consequences of her ill-timed petition, summoned
the gnome of the mine to her presence.&nbsp; He chid her
precipitation, but gave her a small vial containing a delicious
cordial, which should repair the mischief.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may
have observed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the Dwarf neither eats
nor drinks of your food: prevail upon him once <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>to sup at
your table, and pour a few drops of this cordial into his drink:
he must take it willingly, or it will have no effect.&nbsp; In
the sleep which follows the enchanted draught, he will be partly
in my power, and compelled to answer any question you may propose
to him.&nbsp; I need not direct you what to ask; but should he
reply according to our wishes, summon me to your side, and the
business is done.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gnome gave her the potion, and
vanished; while Brunilda diligently applied herself to remove the
suspicions of the Dwarf.&nbsp; In a few days she completely
succeeded; and the flattered demon, on hearing her frequently
complain of the insipidity of supping alone, requested permission
to attend her at table during her supper.&nbsp; This request was
readily granted, and the visit constantly repeated by the Dwarf,
who at length, at her earnest entreaty, consented to partake of
her repast.&nbsp; This was continued till all suspicion was
removed from the mind of the Dwarf; and in one of his happiest
moods she insisted upon his pledging her in wine: he obeyed, and,
with the contents of the bowl, swallowed the magic cordial.&nbsp;
With what anxiety did Brunilda count the hours till she deemed
the Dwarf had retired to rest; how she trembled as she quitted
her chamber for that of her tyrant, whose beard, ere day-break,
she hoped, would be the reward of her courage!&nbsp; With a
beating heart she entered his apartment, and stepping up to him,
demanded in a trembling voice&mdash;&ldquo;Dwarf of the Orange
Tree where hast thou hidden thy head?&rdquo;&nbsp; The stubborn
carcase made no reply to this straight-forward question; and
Brunilda shivered from head to foot as she considered the
possibility of his not yet being asleep, and both hearing and <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>understanding
her question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should it be so, I am indeed utterly
undone,&rdquo; said poor Brunilda; &ldquo;for how shall I be able
to deceive him again, since he must now be aware of my
motives.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another reflection brought more comfort:
she recollected, that as the head only can hear, so the head only
can answer questions; and she determined to walk quietly through
all the caverns, and repeat the question in each.&nbsp; She had
but a short time allowed her for action, as the Dwarf was an
early riser, and she lost none in putting her scheme into
execution.&nbsp; Away she sallied, quick as anxiety would allow
her; unwearied she pursued her task, but ranged through every
apartment of the subterranean palace without obtaining an
answer.&nbsp; She almost thought the Dwarf had removed his head
further off, when, passing through a dismal-looking hole in which
were two iron pillars, she paused to repeat the
charm&mdash;&ldquo;Dwarf of the Orange Tree, where hast thou
hidden thy head?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied a
well-known voice; &ldquo;here, in the pillar on your left
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brunilda started at the sound, but quickly
recovered her spirits, and turning to the east, summoned, as
agreed upon, her coadjutors to her assistance&mdash;&ldquo;Gnome
of this mine, I call thee hither: bring with thee my lover, and
the magic scissors of fate.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the next instant her
friends were at her side, and the scissors glittered in her
hand.&nbsp; She explained in few words the happy result of her
enterprise; the gnome struck the pillar with his mace, the massy
substance divided, and the ugly head of her detested jailer
rolled at the feet of the delighted Brunilda, who, without any
apology, seized it and began most nimbly to ply the magic
scissors.&nbsp; At that moment, the Dwarf, awakened by the <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>near approach
of morning, flew to replace his head upon his shoulders, and
discovered, with the utmost rage and alarm, the intruders upon
his premises.&nbsp; The opened eyes of the head now directed the
motions of the body, which rushed forward and bounced upon them
so suddenly, that Brunilda shrieked and dropped the head, only
retaining a grasp of the beard.&nbsp; The Dwarf as nimbly caught
it, and endeavoured to wrest it from her; but the princess,
invigorated by despair and the exclamations of her friends, kept
fast hold of it, and struggled stoutly with the demon.&nbsp; The
gnome lent her his assistance, in holding the head for her
scissors, while Ludolph kept shoving, thrusting, and hacking with
his sword at the invulnerable demon, in the hope of obliging him
to loosen his grasp of his head.&nbsp; The struggle continued
some minutes, the Dwarf pulling, Ludolph shoving, and Brunilda,
utterly regardless of the scratches he was liberally bestowing
upon her lover, cutting away at the yellow beard with all her
might and main.&nbsp; At length she observed, that the longer she
cut the weaker grew the resistance of the demon, and this gave
new force to her delicate fingers; she snipped on till the last
hair was separated from the chin, and the yellow head and
deformed body both fell senseless together upon the ground.&nbsp;
Brunilda was quietly looking upon her fallen enemy, when the
magic instrument of her success suddenly sprung from her hand,
and she beheld the scissors of fate gliding away rapidly through
the air, as if borne off by an invisible spirit.&nbsp; The
friendly gnome then conducted the lovers to the margrave&rsquo;s
court, (after demanding from Brunilda the magic belt, which he
said would be too dangerous a weapon <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>in the hand of a lady,) and a few
weeks after the battle of Luckow, in which the margrave was
successful, they were united, to the great joy of all parties,
but more particularly of those who expected to be invited to the
wedding dinner.&nbsp; But that dinner!&nbsp; O that dinner! why
what a glory of gastronomy were the dishes!&nbsp; There was the
porpoise stewed in his own oil; beeves roasted whole; and proudly
pre-eminent, even among them, the noble wild boar, the standard
dish of Germany, showed his grinning tusks, now no longer
formidable; roasted cranes, standing upon their long legs, seemed
just stepping out of their platters, making a &ldquo;pretty
drollery;&rdquo; there was the knightly peacock, the bird of
chivalry, dressed out in his brilliant feathers; the stately
swan, sailing about in his golden dish; while herons, turkeys,
geese, and such small fry graced the magnificent board in quality
of side dishes.&nbsp; In short, as the newspapers said,
&ldquo;there were all the delicacies of the season,&rdquo; which
the nobles washed down with floods of Rhenish, until they did not
know what they were swallowing.&nbsp; The day was happier than it
was long, for all thought its felicity was too short-lived,
except Ludolph and his princess, who had many still brighter; as
long years of happiness was the reward of the few months of
suffering.&nbsp; The gnome of the mine returned to his recovered
territories, and, as he had now no farther occasion for their
services, never since that time interfered in the concerns of
mortals.&nbsp; The princess Margaret lived to a good old age, and
died at last in the odour of sanctity, eschewing evil, Satan,
sin, and the yellow Demon of the Orange Tree.</p>

<blockquote><p>Black spirits and white,<br />
Blue spirits and grey,<br />
Mingle, mingle, mingle,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Listen</span>, dear wife,&rdquo;
said Bertram, the forester of Lindenhayn, to his good and
faithful Anne; &ldquo;listen, I beseech you, one moment.&nbsp;
You know I have ever done my utmost to make you happy, and will
still continue to do so; but this project is out of the
question.&nbsp; I entreat you, do not encourage the girl any
farther in the notion; settle the matter decidedly at once, and
she will only drop a few silent tears, and then resign herself to
my wishes; but by these silly delays nothing rational can be
effected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dearest husband,&rdquo; objected the coaxing wife,
&ldquo;may not Catherine be as happy with William the clerk as
with Robert the gamekeeper?&nbsp; Indeed you do not know him: he
is so clever, so good, so kind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;But no marksman,&rdquo; interrupted the
forester.&nbsp; &ldquo;The situation which I hold here has been
possessed by my family for more than two hundred years, and has
always descended down in a straight line from father to
son.&nbsp; If, instead of this girl, Anne, you had brought me a
boy, all would have been well; and the wench, if she had been in
existence, might have chosen for her bridegroom him whom she
loved best; now the thing is impossible.&nbsp; My son-in-law must
also be my successor, and must therefore be a marksman.&nbsp; I
shall have, in the first place, some trouble to obtain the trial
for him; and in the second, if he should not succeed, truly, I
shall have thrown my girl away: so a clever huntsman she shall
have.&nbsp; But observe, if you do not like him, I do not exactly
insist upon Robert: find another active clever fellow for the
girl, I will resign my situation to him, and we shall pass the
rest of our lives free from anxiety and happily with our
children.&nbsp; But hush!&mdash;not another word!&mdash;I beseech
you let me hear no more of the steward&rsquo;s clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother Anne was silenced; she would fain have said a few more
words in favour of poor William, but the forester, who was too
well acquainted with the power of female persuasion, gave her no
further opportunity; he took down his gun, whistled his dog, and
strode away to the forest.&nbsp; The next moment, the fair curled
head of Catherine, her face radiant with smiles, was popped in at
the door&mdash;&ldquo;Is all right, dear mother?&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! no, my child; do not rejoice too
soon;&rdquo; replied the sorrowing Anne.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your father
speaks kindly, but he has determined to give you to nobody but a
huntsman; and I know he will not change his mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Catherine <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>wept, and declared she would sooner die than wed any
other than her own William.&nbsp; Her mother wept, fretted, and
scolded by turns; till at length it was finally determined to
make another grand attack upon the tough heart of old Bertram;
and in the midst of a deliberation respecting the manner in which
this was to be effected, the rejected lover entered the
apartment.</p>
<p>When William had heard the cause of the forester&rsquo;s
objection,&mdash;&ldquo;Is that all, my Catherine,&rdquo; said
he, pressing the weeping girl to his bosom; &ldquo;then keep up
your spirits, dearest, for I will myself become a forester.&nbsp;
I am not unacquainted with woodcraft, for I was, when a boy,
placed under the care of my uncle, the chief forester
Finsterbuch, in order to learn it, and only at the earnest
request of my uncle the steward, I exchanged the shooting-pouch
for the writing-desk.&nbsp; Of what use,&rdquo; continued the
lover, &ldquo;would his situation and fine house be to me, if I
cannot carry my Catherine there as the mistress of it?&nbsp; If
you are not more ambitious than your mother, dearest, and William
the gamekeeper will be as dear to you as William the steward, I
will become a woodsman directly; for the merry life of a forester
is more delightful to me than the constrained habits of the
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, dear William,&rdquo; said Catherine,&mdash;all
the dark clouds of sorrow sweeping rapidly over her countenance,
and leaving only a few drops of glittering sunny rain, sparkling
in her sweet blue eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;O beloved William! if you
will indeed do this, all may be well: hasten to the forest, seek
my father, and speak to him ere he have time to pass his word to
Robert.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Away,&rdquo; replied William,
&ldquo;to the forest; I will seek him out, and offer my services
as gamekeeper: fear nothing, <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Catherine; give me a gun, and now
for the huntsman&rsquo;s salute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What success he had in his undertaking was soon visible to the
anxious eye of Catherine, on her father&rsquo;s return with him
from the forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;A clever lad, that William,&rdquo;
said the old man; &ldquo;who would have expected such a shot in a
townsman?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll speak to the steward myself to-morrow;
it would be a thousand pities such a marksman should not stick to
the noble huntsman craft.&nbsp; Ha! ha! he will become a second
Kuno.&nbsp; But do you know who Kuno was?&rdquo; demanded he of
William.</p>
<p>The latter replied in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you there now!&rdquo; ejaculated Bertram; &ldquo;I
thought I had told you long since.&nbsp; He was my ancestor, the
first who possessed this situation.&nbsp; He was originally a
poor horseboy in the train of the knight of Wippach; but he was
clever, obliging, grew a favourite, and attended his master every
where, to tournaments and hunting parties.&nbsp; Once his knight
accompanied the duke on a grand hunting match, at which all the
nobles attended.&nbsp; The hounds chased a huge stag towards
them, upon whose back, to their great astonishment, sat tied a
human being, shrieking aloud in a most frightful manner.&nbsp;
There existed at that period, among the feudal lords, an inhuman
custom of tying unhappy wretches who incurred their displeasure
(perhaps by slight transgressions against the hunting laws) upon
stags, and then driving them into the forest to perish miserably
by hunger, or at least to be torn to pieces by the
brambles.&nbsp; The duke was excessively enraged at this sight,
and offered immense rewards to any one who would shoot the stag;
but clogged his benefactions with <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>death to the marksman, should his
erring bullet touch the victim, whose life he was desirous to
preserve, in order to ascertain the nature of his offence.&nbsp;
Startled by the conditions, not one of the train attempted the
rescue of the poor wretch, till Kuno, pitying his fate, stepped
forward and boldly offered his services.&nbsp; The duke having
accepted them he took his rifle, loaded it in God&rsquo;s name,
and earnestly recommending the ball to all the saints and angels
in heaven, fired steadily into the bush in which he believed the
stag had taken refuge.&nbsp; His aim was true; the animal
instantly sprung out, plunged to the earth, and expired; but the
poor culprit escaped unhurt, except that his hands and face were
miserably torn by the briers.&nbsp; The duke kept his word well,
and gave to Kuno and his descendants for ever this situation of
forester.&nbsp; But envy naturally follows merit, and my good
ancestor was not long in making the discovery.&nbsp; There were
many of the duke&rsquo;s people who had an eye to this situation,
either for themselves or some cousin or dear friend, and these
persuaded their masters that Kuno&rsquo;s wonderful success was
entirely owing to sorcery; upon which, though they could not turn
him out of his post, they obtained an order that every one of his
descendants should undergo a trial of his skill before he could
be accepted; but which, however, the chief forester of the
district, before whom the essay is made, can render as easy or
difficult as he pleases.&nbsp; I was obliged to shoot a ring out
of the beak of a wooden bird, which was swung backwards and
forwards; but I did not fail, any more than my forefathers; and
he who intends to succeed me, and wed my Catherine, must be at
least as good a marksman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>William, who had listened very attentively, was
delighted with this piece of family history; he seized the old
man&rsquo;s hand, and joyously promised to become, under his
direction, the very first of marksmen; such as even grandfather
Kuno himself should have no cause to blush for.</p>
<p>Scarcely had fourteen happy days passed over his head, ere
William was settled as gamekeeper in the forester&rsquo;s house;
and Bertram, who became fonder of him every day, gave his formal
consent to his engagement with Catherine.&nbsp; It was, however,
agreed that their betrothment should be kept secret until the day
of the marksman&rsquo;s trial, when the forester expected to give
a greater degree of splendour to his family festival by the
presence of the duke&rsquo;s commissary.&nbsp; The bridegroom
swam in an ocean of delight, and so entirely forgot himself and
the whole world in the sweet opening heaven of love, that Bertram
frequently insisted, that he had not been able to hit a single
mark since he had aimed so successfully at Catherine.</p>
<p>And so it really was.&nbsp; From the day of his happy
betrothment, William had encountered nothing but disasters while
shooting.&nbsp; At one time his gun missed fire; at another, when
he aimed at a deer, he lodged the contents of his rifle in the
trunk of a tree: when he came home, and emptied his
shooting-pouch, instead of partridges, rooks and crows, and in
lieu of hares, dead cats.&nbsp; The forester at length grew
seriously angry, and reproved him harshly for his carelessness:
even Catherine began to tremble for the success of the
master-shot.</p>
<p>William redoubled his diligence, but to no purpose; the nearer
the approach of the important day, the more alarming grew his
misfortunes; every <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>shot missed.&nbsp; At length he was almost afraid to
fire a gun, lest he should do some mischief; for he had already
lamed a cow and almost killed the cowherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I insist upon it,&rdquo; said the gamekeeper Rudolph,
one evening, to the party, &ldquo;I insist upon it that some
wizard has bewitched William, for such things could not happen
naturally; therefore let us endeavour to loosen the
charm.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Superstitious stuff!&rdquo;
interrupted Bertram, angrily; &ldquo;an honest woodsman should
not even think of such trash.&nbsp; Do you forget the three
things which a forester ought to have, and with which he will
always be successful, in spite of sorcery?&nbsp; Come, to your
wits, answer my query.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That can I
truly,&rdquo; answered Rudolph; &ldquo;he should have great
skill, a keen dog, and a good gun.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Bertram; &ldquo;with these three
things every charm may be loosened, or the owner of them is a
dunce and no shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under favour, father Bertram,&rdquo; said William,
&ldquo;here is my gun; what have you to object against it? and as
for my skill, I do not like to praise myself, but I think I am as
fair a sportsman as any in the country; nevertheless, it seems as
if all my balls went crooked, or as if the wind blew them away
from the barrel of my gun.&nbsp; Only tell me what I shall
do.&nbsp; I am willing to do any thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
singular,&rdquo; muttered the forester, who did not know what
else to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, William,&rdquo; again began Rudolph,
&ldquo;it is nothing but what I have said.&nbsp; Try only once:
go on a Friday, at midnight, to a cross road, and make a circle
round you with the ramrod, or with a bloody sword, which must be
blessed three times, in the name of
Sammiel.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; interrupted <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>Bertram,
angrily: &ldquo;know ye whose name that is? he is one of the
fiend&rsquo;s dark legion.&nbsp; God protect us and every
Christian from him!&rdquo;&nbsp; William crossed himself
devoutly, and would hear nothing further, though Rudolph still
maintained his opinion.&nbsp; He passed the night in cleaning his
gun, and examining minutely every screw, resolving, at dawn of
day once more to sally forth, and try his fortune in the
forest.&nbsp; He did so, but, alas! in vain.&nbsp; Mischiefs
thickened round him: at ten paces distance he fired three times
at a deer; twice his gun missed fire, and although it went off
the third time, yet the stag bounded away unhurt into the midst
of the forest.&nbsp; Full of vexation, he threw himself under a
tree, and cursed his fate, when suddenly a rustling was heard
among the bushes, and a queer-looking soldier with a wooden leg
came hopping out from among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa! huntsman,&rdquo; he began, laughing at the
disconsolate-looking William, &ldquo;what is the matter with
you?&nbsp; Are you in love, or is your purse empty, or has any
body charmed your gun?&nbsp; Come, don&rsquo;t look so blank;
give me a pipe of tobacco, and we&rsquo;ll have a chat
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William sullenly gave him what he asked, and the soldier threw
himself down in the grass by the side of him.&nbsp; The
conversation naturally turned upon woodcraft, and William related
his misfortunes to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see your gun,&rdquo;
said the soldier.&nbsp; William gave it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
assuredly bewitched,&rdquo; said he of the wooden leg, the moment
he had taken it in his hand; &ldquo;you will not be able to fire
a single shot with it; and if they have done it according to
rule, it will be the same with every gun you shall take into your
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>William was startled; he endeavoured to raise
objections against the stranger&rsquo;s belief in witches, but
the latter offered to give him a proof of the justice of his
opinions.&nbsp; &ldquo;To us soldiers,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;there is nothing strange; and I could tell you many
wonderful things, but which would detain us here till
night.&nbsp; But look here, for instance: this is a ball which is
sure of hitting its mark, because it possesses some particular
virtue: try it; you won&rsquo;t miss.&rdquo;&nbsp; William loaded
his gun, and looked around for an object to aim at.&nbsp; A large
bird of prey hovered high above the forest, like a moving
dot;&mdash;&ldquo;Shoot that kite,&rdquo; said the one-legged
companion.&nbsp; William laughed at his absurdity, for the bird
was hovering at a height which the eye itself could scarcely
reach.&nbsp; &ldquo;Laugh not, but fire,&rdquo; said the other,
grimly; &ldquo;I will lay my wooden leg that it
falls.&rdquo;&nbsp; William fired, the black dot sunk, and a huge
kite fell bleeding to the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would not be
surprised at that,&rdquo; said he of the wooden leg to the
huntsman, who was speechless and staring with astonishment;
&ldquo;you would not, I repeat, be surprised at that, if you were
better acquainted with the wonders of your craft.&nbsp; Even the
casting such balls as these is one of the least important things
in it; it merely requires dexterity and courage, because it must
be done in the night.&nbsp; I will teach you for nothing when we
meet again; now I must away, for the bell has told seven.&nbsp;
In the mean time&mdash;here, try a few of my balls; still you
look incredulous&mdash;well&mdash;till we meet
again.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>The soldier gave William a handful of balls, and
departed.&nbsp; Full of astonishment, and still distrusting the
evidence of his senses, the latter <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>tried another of the balls, and
again struck an almost unattainable object: he loaded his gun in
the usual manner, and again missed the easiest!&nbsp; He darted
forward to follow the crippled soldier, but the latter was no
longer in the forest; and William was obliged to remain satisfied
with the promise which he had given of meeting him again
hereafter.</p>
<p>Great joy it gave to the honest forester when William
returned, as before, loaded with game from the forest.&nbsp; He
was now called upon to explain the circumstance; but not being
prepared to give a reason, and above all, dreading to say any
thing upon the subject of his infallible balls, he attributed his
ill luck to a fault in his gun, which he had only, he pretended,
last night discovered and rectified.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did I not tell
you so, wife,&rdquo; said Bertram, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
demon was lodged in the barrel; and the goblin which threw down
father Kuno this morning, sat grinning, on the rusty
nail.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What say you of a goblin,&rdquo;
demanded William; &ldquo;and what has happened to father
Kuno?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Simply this,&rdquo; replied Bertram:
&ldquo;his portrait fell of itself from the wall this morning,
just as the bell tolled seven; and the silly woman settled it
that a goblin must be at the bottom of the mischief, and that we
are haunted accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At seven,&rdquo; repeated William, &ldquo;at
seven!&rdquo; and he thought, with a strange feeling of affright,
of the soldier who parted from him exactly at that moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, seven,&rdquo; continued Bertram, still
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not wonder at your surprise; it is
not a usual ghostly hour, but Anne would have it so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The latter shook her head doubtfully, and prayed that all might
end well; while William <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>shivered from head to foot, and
would secretly have vowed not to use the magic balls, but that
the thought of his ill luck haunted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only one of
them,&rdquo; said he, internally; &ldquo;only one of them for the
master-shot, and then I have done with them for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the forester urged him the next instant to
accompany him into the forest; and he dared not excite fresh
suspicions of his want of skill, nor offend the old man by
refusing, he was again compelled to make use of his wondrous
balls; and in the course of a few days he had so accustomed
himself to the use of them, and so entirely reconciled his
conscience to their doubtful origin, that he saw nothing sinful
or even objectionable in the business.&nbsp; He constantly
traversed the forest, in the hope of meeting the strange giver of
the balls; for the handful had decreased to two, and if he wished
to make sure of the master-shot, the utmost economy was
necessary.&nbsp; One day he even refused to accompany Bertram,
for the next was to be the day of trial, and the chief forester
was expected; it was possible he might require other proofs than
the mere formal essay, and William thus felt himself
secure.&nbsp; But in the evening, instead of the commissary, came
a messenger from the duke, with an order for a large delivery of
game, and to announce that the visit of the chief forester would
be postponed for eight days longer.</p>
<p>William felt as if he could have sunk into the bosom of the
earth, as he listened to the message, and his excessive alarm
would have excited strange suspicions, if all present had not
been ready to ascribe it to the delay of his expected
nuptials.&nbsp; He was now obliged to sacrifice at least one of
his balls, but he solemnly swore nothing should rob him of the
other but the forester&rsquo;s master-shot.</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>Bertram was outrageously angry when William returned
from the forest with only one stag; for the delivery order was
considerable.&nbsp; He was still more angry the next day at noon,
when Rudolph returned loaded with an immense quantity of game,
and William returned with none; he threatened to dismiss him, and
retract his promise respecting Catherine, if he did not bring
down at least two deer on the following day.&nbsp; Catherine was
in the greatest consternation, and earnestly besought him to make
use of his utmost skill, and not let a thought of her interrupt
his duties while occupied in the forest.&nbsp; He
departed&mdash;his heart loaded with despair.&nbsp; Catherine, he
saw too plainly, was lost to him for ever; and nothing remained
but the choice of the manner in which he should destroy his
happiness.&nbsp; Whilst he stood lost in the agonising
anticipation of his impending doom, a herd of deer approached
close to him.&nbsp; Mechanically he felt for his last ball; it
felt tremendously heavy in his hand: he was on the point of
dropping it back, resolving to preserve his treasure at every
hazard, when suddenly he saw&mdash;O sight of joy!&mdash;the
one-legged soldier approaching.&nbsp; Delightedly he let the ball
drop into the barrel, fired, brought down a brace of deer, and
hastened forward to meet his friend; but he was gone!&nbsp;
William could not discover him in the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark ye, William!&rdquo; said the forester to him in
the evening, rousing him from the torpor of grief into which he
had fallen; &ldquo;you must resent this affront as earnestly as
myself: nobody shall dare utter falsehoods of our ancestor Kuno,
nor accuse him as Rudolph is now doing.&nbsp; I insist,&rdquo;
continued he, turning again to the latter, &ldquo;if good angels
helped him, (which was very likely, <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>for in the Old Testament we
frequently read of instances of their protection,) we ought to be
grateful, and praise the wonderful goodness of God.&nbsp; But
nobody shall accuse Kuno of practising the black art.&nbsp; He
died happily&mdash;ay, and holily, in his bed, surrounded by
children and grandchildren,&mdash;which he who carries on a
correspondence with the evil one never does.&nbsp; I saw a
terrible example of that myself, when I was a forester&rsquo;s
boy in Bohemia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hear how it happened, good Bertram,&rdquo; said
all the listeners; and the forester nodded gravely, and
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shiver when I think of it; but I will tell you
nevertheless.&nbsp; When a young man practising with other youths
under the chief foresters, there used frequently to join us a
town lad, a fine daring fellow, who, being a great lover of field
sports, came out to us as often as he could.&nbsp; He would have
made a good marksman, but was too flighty and thoughtless, so
that he frequently missed his mark.&nbsp; Once, when we ridiculed
his awkwardness, we provoked him into a rage, and he swore by all
that was holy that he would fire with a more certain aim than any
gamekeeper in the country, and that no animal should escape him,
either in the air or on the earth.&nbsp; But he kept his light
oath badly.&nbsp; A few days afterward an unknown huntsman roused
us early, and told us that a man was lying in the road and dying
without assistance.&nbsp; It was poor Schmid.&nbsp; He was
covered with wounds and blood, as if he had been torn by wild
beasts: he could not speak, for he was quite senseless, with
scarcely any appearance of life.&nbsp; He was conveyed to Prague,
and just before his death declared, that he had been out with an
old mountain huntsman <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>to the cross road, in order to cast
the magic balls, which are sure of hitting their mark; but that
making some fault or omission, the demon had treated him so
roughly that it would cost him his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he not explain?&rdquo; asked William,
shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; replied the forester.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
declared before a court of justice, that he went out to the cross
road with the old gamekeeper; that they made a circle with a
bloody sword, and afterwards set it round with skulls and
bones.&nbsp; The mountain hunter then gave his directions to
Schmid as to what he was to do: he was to begin when the clock
struck eleven to cast the balls, and neither to cast more nor
fewer than sixty-three; one either above or under this number
would, when the bell tolled midnight, be the cause of his
destruction: neither was he to speak a single word during his
work, nor move from the circle whatever might happen, above,
below, or around him.&nbsp; Fulfilling these conditions sixty
balls would be sure of hitting, and the remaining three only
would miss.&nbsp; Schmid had actually begun casting the balls
when, according to what we could gather from him, he saw such
cruel and dreadful apparitions, that he at length shrieked and
sprung out of the circle, falling senseless to the ground; from
which trance he did not recover till under the hands of the
physician in Prague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven preserve us!&rdquo; said the forester&rsquo;s
wife, crossing herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a very deadly sin
undoubtedly,&rdquo; pursued Bertram, &ldquo;and a true woodsman
would scorn such a practice.&nbsp; He needs nothing but skill,
and a good gun, as you have lately experienced, William.&nbsp; I
would not, for my own part, <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>fire off such balls for any price; I
should always fear the fiend would, at some time or other,
conduct the ball to his own mark instead of to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night drew round them with the conclusion of the
forester&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; <i>He</i> went to his quiet bed,
but William remained in restless agony.&nbsp; It was in vain that
he attempted to compose himself.&nbsp; Sleep fled entirely from
his spirit.&nbsp; Strange objects flitted past him, and hovered
like dark omens over his pillow.&nbsp; The strange soldier of the
forest, Schmid, Catherine, the duke&rsquo;s commissary, all
rushed before his eyes, and his fevered imagination converted
them into the most dreadful groups.&nbsp; Now, the miserable
Schmid stood warningly before him, and hollowly pointed to his
newly bleeding wounds; then the dark distorted face faded to the
pallid features of Catherine wrestling with the strength of
death; while the wild soldier of the forest stood mocking his
agony with a hellish laugh of scorn.&nbsp; The scene then changed
to his mind, and he stood in the forest before the commissary,
preparing for the master-shot.&nbsp; He
aimed&mdash;fired&mdash;missed.&nbsp; Catherine sunk down on the
earth.&nbsp; Bertram drove him away; while the one-legged
soldier, now again a friend, brought him fresh balls; but too
late&mdash;the trial was over, and he was lost.</p>
<p>In this manner wore away the agonised night, and with the
earliest dawn he sought the forest, hoping to meet with the
soldier; the clear morning air chased away the dark images of
sleep from his brow, and ennerved his drooping spirit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;because I cannot
understand what is mysterious, must the mystery therefore be a
sin?&nbsp; Is what I seek so contrary to nature that it requires
the aid of spirits to obtain <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>it?&nbsp; Does not man govern the
mighty instinct of animals, and make them move according to the
will of their master?&nbsp; Why then should we not be able, by
natural means, to command the course of inanimate metal which
receives force and motion only through him?&nbsp; Nature is rich
in wonders which we do not comprehend, and shall I forfeit my
happiness for an ignorant prejudice only?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Spirits
I will not call upon, but nature and her hidden powers I will
challenge and use, even though unable to explain its
mystery.&nbsp; I will seek the soldier, and, if I cannot find
him, I will at least be bolder than Schmid, for I have a better
cause.&nbsp; He was urged by presumption, I by love and
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the soldier appeared not, however earnestly William sought
him; neither could any of those of whom he inquired give the
slightest information respecting him, and two days were wasted in
these anxious and fruitless inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be it so,&rdquo; exclaimed the unhappy young man;
and in a fit of despair he resolved to cast the magic balls in
the forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;My days,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;are
numbered to me; this night will I seek the cross road.&nbsp; Into
its silent and solitary recess no one will dare to intrude; and
the terrible circle will I not leave till the fearful work shall
be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the shadows of evening fell upon the earth, and after
William had provided lead, bullet-mould, and coals, for his
nocturnal occupation, he was gently detained by Bertram, who
felt, he said, so severe an oppression, that he entreated him to
remain in his chamber during the night.&nbsp; Catherine offered
her services, but they were, to her astonishment, declined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At any other time,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;I should
have preferred you, <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>but to-night it must be
William.&nbsp; I shall be happier if he will remain with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William hesitated.&nbsp; He grew sick in his inmost
heart.&nbsp; He would have objected, but Catherine&rsquo;s
entreaties were so irresistible, that he had nothing to oppose
against her wishes.&nbsp; He remained in the chamber, and in the
morning Bertram&rsquo;s dark fears had faded, and he laughed at
his own absurdity.&nbsp; He proposed going to the forest, but
William, who intended to devote the day to his search for the
soldier, dissuaded him, and departed alone.&nbsp; He went, but
returned disappointed, and once more resolved to seek the forest
at night.&nbsp; As he approached the house, Catherine met
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beloved William,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you
have a visitor, and a dear one, but you must guess who it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was not at all disposed to guess, and still less to
receive visits; for at that time the dearest friend would have
been the most unwelcome intruder.&nbsp; He answered peevishly,
and was thinking of a pretext to turn back, when the door of the
house opened, and the pale moon threw her soft ray upon a
venerable old man, in the garb of a huntsman, who extended his
arms towards him; and &ldquo;William!&rdquo; said a well-known
voice, and the next instant the young forester found himself
folded to the bosom of his beloved uncle.</p>
<p>Ah! magic of early ties, dear recollections, and filial
gratitude!&nbsp; William felt them all; his heart was full of
joy, and all other thoughts were forgotten.&nbsp; Suddenly spoke
the warning voice to the tranquil happy dreamer.&nbsp; The
midnight hour struck, and William, with a shudder, remembered
what he had lost.&nbsp; &ldquo;But one night more remains to
me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;to-morrow, or never.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
violent agony did not escape the eye of his uncle, <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>but he
ascribed it to fatigue, and excused himself for detaining him
from his needful rest, on account of his own departure, which he
could not delay beyond the following day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet grieve
not, William,&rdquo; said the old man as he retired to rest;
&ldquo;grieve not for this short hour thus spent, you will only
sleep the sounder for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; William shivered, for to
his ear these words conveyed a deeper meaning.&nbsp; There was a
dark foreboding in his heart, that the execution of his plan
would for ever banish the quiet of sleep from his soul.</p>
<p>But day dawned&mdash;passed&mdash;and evening descended.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It must be now or never,&rdquo; thought William,
&ldquo;for to-morrow will be the day of trial.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
females had been busied in preparations for the wedding and the
reception of their distinguished guest.&nbsp; Anne embraced
William when he returned, and, for the first time, saluted him
with the dear name of son.&nbsp; The tender joy of a young and
happy bride glittered in the sweet eyes of Catherine.&nbsp; The
supper-table was covered with flowers, good food, and large
bottles of long-hoarded wine from the stores of Bertram.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;this is our own
festival; let us, therefore, be happy: to-morrow we shall not be
alone, though you may perhaps be happier.&nbsp; I have invited
the priest, dear William, and when the trial is
over.&rdquo;&mdash;A loud shriek from Catherine interrupted the
forester.&nbsp; Kuno&rsquo;s picture had again fallen from its
place, and had struck her severely on the forehead.&nbsp; Bertram
grew angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot conceive,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;why this picture is not hung properly; this is the second
time it has given us a fright: are you hurt,
Catherine?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is of no consequence,&rdquo;
replied the maiden, gently wiping away the blood from her bright
curls; &ldquo;I am less hurt than frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>William grew sick when he beheld her pale face, and
forehead bathed in blood.&nbsp; So he had seen her in his
distempered dreams on that dreadful night: and this reality
conjured up all those fearful fantasies anew.&nbsp; His
determination of proceeding in his plan was shaken; but the wine,
which he drank in greater quantities than usual, filled him with
a wild courage, and ennerved him to undertake its
execution.&nbsp; The clock struck nine.&nbsp; Love and valour
must combat with danger, thought William.&nbsp; But he sought in
vain for a decent pretence to leave his Catherine.&nbsp; How
could he quit her on her bridal eve?&nbsp; Time flew with the
rapidity of an arrow, and he suffered agonies even in the soft
arms of rewarding love.&nbsp; Ten o&rsquo;clock struck: the
decisive moment was come.&nbsp; Without taking leave, William
started from his bride, and left the house to range in the
forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whither go you, William?&rdquo; said her
mother, following him, alarmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have shot a deer,
which I had forgotten,&rdquo; answered the youth.&nbsp; She still
entreated, and Catherine looked terrified, for she felt that
there was something (though she knew not what) to fear, from his
distracted manner.&nbsp; But their supplications were
unheeded.&nbsp; William sprung from them both, and hastened into
the forest.</p>
<p>The moon was on the wane, and gleamed a dark red light above
the horizon.&nbsp; Grey clouds flew rapidly past, and sometimes
darkened the surrounding country, which was soon relighted up by
the wild and glittering moonlight.&nbsp; The birch and aspen
trees nodded like spectres in the shade; and to William the
silver poplar was a white shadowy figure, which solemnly waved,
and beckoned him to return.&nbsp; He started, and felt as <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>if the two
extraordinary interpositions to his plan, and the repeated falls
of the picture, were the last admonitions of his departing angel,
who thus warned him against the commission of an unblessed
deed.&nbsp; Once more he wavered in his intention.&nbsp; Now he
had even determined to return, when a voice whispered close to
him, &ldquo;Fool! hast thou not already used the magic balls, and
dost thou only dread the toil of labouring for them?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He paused.&nbsp; The moon shone brilliantly out from a dark
cloud, and lighted up the tranquil roof of the forester&rsquo;s
humble dwelling.&nbsp; William saw Catherine&rsquo;s window shine
in the silvery ray, and he stretched out his arms towards it, and
again directed his steps towards his home.&nbsp; Then the voice
rose whisperingly again around him, and, &ldquo;Hence!&mdash;to
thy work!&mdash;away!&rdquo; it murmured; while a strong gust of
wind brought to his ear the stroke of the second quarter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To my work,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;ay; it is cowardly
to return half way&mdash;foolish to give up the great object
when, for a lesser, I have already perhaps risked my
salvation.&nbsp; I will finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode rapidly forward.&nbsp; The wind drove the fugitive
clouds over the moon, and William entered the deep darkness of
the forest.&nbsp; Now he stood upon the cross road; the magic
circle was drawn; the skulls and bones of the dead laid in order
around it; the moon buried herself deeper in the cloudy mass, and
left the glimmering coals at intervals fanned into a blaze by the
fitful gusts of wind, alone to lighten the midnight deed, with a
wild and melancholy glare.&nbsp; Remotely the third quarter
sounded from a dull and heavy tower clock.&nbsp; William put the
casting ladle upon the coals, and threw the lead into it,
together with <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>three balls, which had already hit their mark,
according to the huntsman&rsquo;s usage: then the forest began to
be in motion; the night ravens, owls, and bats, fluttered up and
down, blinded by the glare of light.&nbsp; They fell from their
boughs, and placed themselves among the bones around the circle,
where, with hollow croakings and wild jabberings, they held an
unintelligible conversation with the skulls.&nbsp; Momentarily
their numbers increased, and among and above them hovered pale
cloudy forms, some shaped like animals, some like human
beings.&nbsp; The gusts of wind sported frightfully with their
dusky vapoury forms, scattering and reuniting them like the dews
of the evening shades.&nbsp; One form alone stood motionless and
unchanged near the circle, gazing with fixed and woful looks at
William; once it lifted up its pale hands in sorrow, and seemed
to sigh.&nbsp; The fire burned gloomily at the moment; but a
large grey owl flapped its wings, and fanned the dying embers
into light.&nbsp; William turned shivering away; for the
countenance of his dead mother gazed mournfully at him from the
dark and dusky figure.</p>
<p>The bell tolled eleven; the pale figure vanished with a groan;
the owls and night ravens flew screeching up into the air, and
the skulls and bones clattered beneath their wings.&nbsp; William
knelt down by his hearth of coals.&nbsp; He began steadily to
cast, and, with the last sound of the bell, the first ball fell
from the mould.</p>
<p>The owls and the skulls were quiet: but along the road an old
woman, bent down with the weight of age, advanced towards the
circle.&nbsp; She was hung round with wooden spoons, ladles, and
other kitchen utensils, which made a frightful <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>clattering.&nbsp; The owls screeched at her approach,
and caressed her with their wings.&nbsp; Arrived at the circle,
she stooped down to seize the bones and the skulls; but the coals
hissed flames at her, and she drew back her withered hands from
the fire.&nbsp; Then she paced round the circle, and grinning and
chattering, held up her wares towards William.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give
me the skulls,&rdquo; she gabbled; &ldquo;give me the skulls, and
I will give thee my treasures; give me the skulls, the skulls;
what canst thou want with the trash?&nbsp; Thou art
mine&mdash;mine, dear bridegroom; none can help thee: thou canst
not escape me; thou must lead with me in the bridal dance.&nbsp;
Come away, thou bridegroom mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>William&rsquo;s breast throbbed; but he remained silent, and
hastened on with his work.&nbsp; The old woman was not a stranger
to him.&nbsp; A mad beggar had often haunted the neighbourhood,
until she found an asylum in the mad-house.&nbsp; Now, he knew
not whether her appearance was reality or a delusion.&nbsp; In a
short time she grew enraged, threw down her stick, and chattered
anew at William.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take these for our nuptial
night,&rdquo; she cried: &ldquo;the bridal bed is ready, and
to-morrow, when evening cometh, thou wilt be wedded to me.&nbsp;
Come soon, my love; delay not, my bridegroom; come
soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she hobbled slowly away into the
forest.</p>
<p>Suddenly there arose a rattling like the noise of wheels,
mingled with the cracking of whips and shouting of men.&nbsp; A
carriage came headlong, with six horses and outriders.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the meaning of all this in the road?&rdquo; cried
the foremost horseman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Room there!&rdquo;&nbsp;
William looked up.&nbsp; Fire sprung from the hoofs of the
horses, <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>and round the wheels of the carriage: it shone like the
glimmering of phosphorus.&nbsp; He suspected a magical delusion,
and remained quiet.&nbsp; &ldquo;On, on, upon it!&mdash;over
it!&mdash;down! down!&rdquo; cried the horseman; and in a moment
the whole troop stormed in headlong upon the circle.&nbsp;
William plunged down to the earth, and the horses reared
furiously above his head; but the airy cavalry whirled high in
the air with the carriage, and, after turning several times round
the magic circle, disappeared in a storm of wind, which tore the
tops of the mightiest trees, and scattered their branches to a
distance.</p>
<p>Some time elapsed ere William could recover from his
terror.&nbsp; At length he compelled his trembling fingers to be
steady, and cast a few balls without farther interruption.&nbsp;
Again the well-known tower clock struck, and to him in the
dreadful solitary circle, consoling as the voice of humanity,
rose the sound from the habitations of men, but the clock struck
the quarter thrice.&nbsp; He shuddered at the lightning-like
flight of time; for a third part of his work was hardly
done.&nbsp; Again the clock struck, for the fourth
time!&mdash;Horror!&mdash;his strength was annihilated, every
limb was palsied, and the mould fell out of his trembling
hand.&nbsp; He listened, in the quiet resignation of despair, for
the stroke of the full, the terrible, midnight hour.&nbsp; The
sound hesitated&mdash;delayed&mdash;was silent.&nbsp; To palter
with the awful midnight was too daring and too dangerous even to
the dreadful powers of darkness.&nbsp; Hope again raised the sunk
heart of William; he hastily drew out his watch, and beheld it
pointing to the second quarter of the hour.&nbsp; He looked
gratefully up towards heaven, and a feeling of piety moderated
the <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>transport, which, contrary to the laws of the dark
world, would otherwise have burst forth in loud and joyous
exclamations.</p>
<p>Strengthened, by the experience of the last half-hour, against
any new delusion, William now went boldly on with his work.&nbsp;
Every thing was silent around him, except that the owls snored in
their uneasy sleep, and at intervals struck their beaks against
the bones of the dead.&nbsp; Suddenly it was broken by a
crackling among the bushes.&nbsp; The sound was familiar to the
sportsman, and, as he expected, a huge wild boar broke through
the briers, and came foaming towards the circle.&nbsp; Believing
this to be a reality, he sprung hastily on his feet, seized his
gun, and attempted to fire.&nbsp; Not a single spark came from
the flint.&nbsp; Startled at his danger, he drew his
hunting-knife to attack it,&mdash;when the bristly savage, like
the carriage and the horses, ascended high above his head, and
vanished into the silent fields of air.</p>
<p>The anxious lover worked on steadily to regain the time he had
so unhappily lost.&nbsp; Sixty balls were cast.&nbsp; He looked
joyfully upwards; the clouds were dispersing, and the moon again
threw her bright rays upon the surrounding country; he was
rejoicing in the approaching end of his labours, when an agonised
voice, in the tones of Catherine, shrieked out the name of
&ldquo;William!&rdquo;&nbsp; In the next moment, he beheld his
beloved dart from among the bushes, and gaze fearfully around
her.&nbsp; Following her distracted steps, and panting closely
behind her, trod the mad beggar woman, extending her withered
arms towards the fugitive, whose light dress, fluttering in the
wind, she repeatedly attempted to grasp.&nbsp; Catherine
collected her expiring strength in one desperate effort to
escape, when <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>the long-sought soldier of the forest planted himself
before her and delayed her flight.&nbsp; The hesitation of the
moment gained time for the mad woman, who sprung wildly upon
Catherine, and grasped her in her long and fleshless hands.&nbsp;
William could endure it no longer, he dashed the last ball from
his hand, and was on the point of springing from the circle, when
the bell tolled midnight, and the delusion vanished.&nbsp; The
owls knocked the skulls and bones cluttering against each other,
and flew up again to their hiding-places; the coals were suddenly
extinguished; and William sunk, exhausted with fatigue, to the
earth; but there was no rest for him in the forest; he was again
disturbed by the slow and sullen approach of a stranger, mounted
upon a huge coal-black steed: he stopped before the demolished
magic circle, and, addressing the huntsman,&mdash;&ldquo;You have
stood the trial well,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what do you require
of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of you, stranger, nothing,&rdquo; replied William;
&ldquo;of that of which I had need, I have prepared for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But with my assistance,&rdquo; continued the stranger;
&ldquo;therefore a share of it belongs to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the huntsman; &ldquo;I have
neither hired you nor called upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horseman smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are bolder than your
equals are wont to be,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take then the
balls which you have cast: sixty for you, three for me.&nbsp; The
first hit, the second miss.&nbsp; When we meet again you will
understand me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William turned away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not meet you again; I
will never see you more,&rdquo; he cried, trembling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why do you turn from me?&rdquo; demanded the stranger,
with a horrible laugh: &ldquo;do <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>you know me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No;
no,&rdquo; said the huntsman, shuddering; &ldquo;I know you not;
I will not even look upon you.&nbsp; Whoever you may be, leave
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black horseman turned his steed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rising
hairs of your head,&rdquo; cried he with gloomy gravity,
&ldquo;declare that you do know me.&nbsp; You are right; I am he
whom you name in the secrecy of your soul, and shudder to think
you have done so.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these words he disappeared, and
the trees under which he had stood let their withered branches
sink helpless and dead to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven! William,&rdquo; said Catherine, on
remarking his pale and distracted look on his return after
midnight; &ldquo;what has happened to you? you look as if you had
just risen from the grave.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the night
air,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and I am not well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, William,&rdquo; said the forester, who had just
entered, &ldquo;why then would you go to the forest: something
has happened to you there.&nbsp; Boy, you cannot thus blind
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was startled; the sad solemnity of Bertram&rsquo;s
manner struck him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, something has
occurred,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but have patience for a few
days, and all shall be explained to your
satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Willingly, dear son,&rdquo;
interrupted the forester; &ldquo;question him no further,
Catherine.&nbsp; Go to your needful rest, William, and indulge in
hope of the future.&nbsp; He who goes on in his occupation openly
and honestly, never can be harmed by the evil spirits of the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William had need of all his dissimulation; for the old
man&rsquo;s observations so nearly meeting the truth, his
forbearing love, and unshaken confidence in William&rsquo;s
honesty, altogether distracted his mind: he hastened to his room,
determined to <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>destroy the magical preparation.&nbsp; &ldquo;But one
ball&mdash;only one will I use,&rdquo; exclaimed he, weeping
aloud, with his folded hands held up to heaven; &ldquo;and surely
this determination will efface the sin of the deed I have
committed.&nbsp; With a thousand acts of penitence I will make
atonement for what is past, for I cannot now step back without
betraying my happiness, my honour, and my love.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
with this resolution he calmed the tumult of his spirits, and met
the rays of the morning sun with more tranquillity than he had
dared to hope.</p>
<p>The commissary of the duke arrived; he proposed a shooting
party in the forest, before the trial of skill took place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For, though we must certainly retain the old form,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;of the essay shot, yet the skill of the huntsman
is, after all, best proved in the forest: so come, young
marksman, to the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William&rsquo;s cheek grew pale, and he earnestly tried to
excuse himself from accompanying them.&nbsp; But, when this was
refused by the chief forester, he entreated at least to be
allowed to fire his trial shot before their departure.&nbsp; Old
Bertram shook his head, doubtingly: &ldquo;William,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;should my suspicion of yesterday be
just&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; replied the youth; and no
longer daring to hesitate, he departed with them to the
forest.</p>
<p>Bertram had in vain endeavoured to suppress his forebodings
and assume a cheerful countenance.&nbsp; Catherine too was
dejected, and it was not until the arrival of the priest that she
recollected her nuptial garland: her mother had locked it up,
and, in her haste to open the chest, broke the lock, and was
obliged to send into the village for another wreath, as too much
time had been <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>wasted in endeavouring to recover the first.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let them give you the handsomest,&rdquo; said Anne to the
little messenger, &ldquo;the very handsomest they
have.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy accordingly chose the most glittering,
and the seller, who misunderstood him gave him a death garland,
composed of myrtle and rosemary, intermingled with silver.&nbsp;
The mother and daughter beheld and recognized the mysterious
intimation of fate; they embraced each other in silence, and
endeavoured to smile away their terror, in imputing it to the
boy&rsquo;s mistake.&nbsp; Again the broken lock was tried; it
opened easily now; the wreaths were changed, and the bridal
garland was twined around Catherine&rsquo;s brilliant locks.</p>
<p>The sportsmen returned from the forest.&nbsp; The commissary
was inexhaustible on the subject of William&rsquo;s wondrous
skill.&nbsp; &ldquo;It almost appears ridiculous,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;after such proofs, to require any further trial; yet, in
honour of the old custom, we must perform what appears
superfluous; we will therefore finish the business as quickly as
possible.&nbsp; There upon that pillar, sits a dove, shoot
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said
Catherine, hastily approaching, &ldquo;do not shoot that
dove.&nbsp; Alas! in my sleep last night I was myself a dove, and
my mother, while fastening a ring round my neck, on your
approaching us, became covered with blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William drew back his gun; but the chief forester
smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;So timid, little maiden!&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that will never do for a huntsman&rsquo;s bride: come,
courage! courage!&mdash;or is the dove a favourite,
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;it is but
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; replied the commissary,
&ldquo;have courage; and now, William, fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>William fired, and, in the same moment, Catherine sunk, with a
loud scream, to the earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silly girl,&rdquo;
exclaimed the commissary, lifting her up: but a stream of blood
flowed over her face, her forehead was shattered, for the ball of
the rifle was lodged in the wound.&nbsp; William turned on
hearing loud shrieks behind him, and beheld his Catherine pale,
weltering in her own blood, and by her side the soldier of the
forest, who, with a fiendish laugh of scorn, pointed to his dying
victim, and cried aloud to William, &ldquo;Sixty hit, three
miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accursed fiend!&rdquo; shrieked the wretched youth,
striking at the detested form with his sword, &ldquo;hast thou
thus deceived me?&rdquo;&nbsp; His agony permitted no further
expression, for he sunk senseless to the earth by the side of the
victim bride.&nbsp; The commissary and priest in vain endeavoured
to console the childless, heart-broken parents.&nbsp; The mother
had scarcely laid the prophetic garland of death upon the bosom
of the bridal corpse, when her sorrow and life expired with her
last-shed tear: the solitary father soon followed her, and the
miserable William closed his life in the mad-house.</p>

FORTUNES OF DE LA POLE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when

shake.<br />
Then a spirit passed before my face, the hair of my head stood

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Job</i> chap. iv.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the seventeenth century,
on a very cold November morning, a gentleman of Winchester was
returning to his home, by a road which then led by the borders of
the New Forest.&nbsp; He was conversing gaily with his
attendants, when his dogs arrested the mirth of the party, by
darting suddenly into the mazes of the forest, and signifying
their discovery of some unusual object by loud and continued
howls.&nbsp; Sir Bernard Courtenay instantly followed their
track, and was startled by discovering, amid the tangled bushes,
the corpse of a man, frightfully mangled, and which appeared to
have lain some time in its concealment.&nbsp; Little observation
was necessary to point out the identity of the
sufferer,&mdash;Sir Bernard Courtenay almost instantly recognized
an intimate friend; and, with deep and painful commiseration,
prepared to assist his attendants to convey the body to its
home.</p>
<p>Many conjectures were immediately afloat, as <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>to the
cause and perpetrator of this dreadful act, and, as is ever usual
in such cases, many more absurd and irrational than
just:&mdash;there was no apparent possibility of tracing the
fact; it appeared to mock all the art and all the power of
justice.&nbsp; He had not been robbed&mdash;murder alone had been
intended, and had alone been perpetrated; so that one fact at
least was clear, that this deed had been the work of an enemy: no
common one, it was presumed, if the appearance of the corpse
might weigh any thing in evidence; it was mangled fearfully, and
the frightful distension of the muscles, the grim and rigid
expression of the features, the many deep and bloody wounds upon
the body, and the firm and powerful grasp with which the strained
fingers of one hand clenched a dark lock of human hair, while
those of the other as firmly closed over the hilt of a broken
dagger, gave tokens that a fierce and terrible struggle had
preceded his unexpected destruction.&nbsp; It was hoped, that
some corresponding token of wounds and fierce exertion might lead
to a discovery of the murderer; for none deemed, after beholding
the body, and calling to mind the noble courage of the victim
when in life, that the destroyer could pass from that gripe
unharmed.</p>
<p>He who had thus fallen, was one for whom every eye had a tear
and every heart a genuine sigh; he had been the friend of all,
the enemy of none; he was young, beautiful, and brave; and his
native town had looked up to him as one who was to add new glory
to her venerable name, and new lustre to his own princely blood;
and cut off in the beginning of his career, the very high day of
his happiness and beauty, and so cut off&mdash;who was there that
did not lament for John de la <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Pole?&nbsp; But, though all
Winchester, and the county in whose bosom it lies, sorrowed over
the corpse of John de la Pole, the agony borne from his death was
to be found in his family alone; there he had been adored, and
there most truly and deeply was his sad destiny accused.&nbsp;
His young and lovely wife, scarce past her bridal year,&mdash;she
who had, long before his marriage, been the secret object of his
ardent love, and who, upon the death of his father, became the
object of his choice&mdash;of her grief it was scarcely possible
to think without affright; for, in that convulsion of soul into
which, in the first horror of eternal separation from all we
love, we invariably fall, she had withdrawn herself from all
consolation of her friends&mdash;all succour of her attendants;
and report whispered that she was using means, though quietly,
(in order to avoid public shame,) to shorten a life which was now
become odious and burthensome.&nbsp; To this cruel resolution she
had been driven by a terrible incident; on the morning of the
discovery of the body, she had, believing him to be on his road
towards his home, ascended her carriage in order to meet him, and
was driving cheerfully through the town, when her progress was
arrested by the appearance of the crowd bearing the corpse of her
husband.&nbsp; She recognized it at a glance, and, before they
were aware of their imprudence, a piercing shriek announced to
the people that she did so.&nbsp; She took another searching,
distracted look at the body, and shrunk into the arms of her
attendants, insensible and silent.&nbsp; <i>They</i> thought she
was dead&mdash;it would not have been wonderful if she had been;
the husband of her soul was lying before her, a deep gash across
his throat, another had disfigured his snowy brow, and almost <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>divided his
once lofty head, while the bosom upon which she had been
accustomed to repose was mangled and rent by stabs and blows too
many to number&mdash;what an object for a young and loving
wife!&nbsp; Remembrance was terrible to her, and the inability of
justice to discover the murderer added despair to her grief, and
thus compelled her to seek for consolation only in the prospect
of death.</p>
<p>As bitter a grief, though perhaps not so deep or desperate,
had fastened upon the heart of the only survivor of his family, a
youth of twenty, of a beauty and virtue equal to his lamented
brother, and who had indeed ample reason for his regrets.&nbsp;
John de la Pole had been as a father to his youth, and loved him
with a warmth far surpassing the kindness of ordinary
brotherhood.&nbsp; Eustace had never been taught to remember that
he was the younger, for the fortunes of his house were open to
him, and the purse of the elder was common to both.&nbsp; On the
marriage of the latter with his beloved Agatha, the younger had
timidly hinted at his fears of an interruption to their
friendship; but John had remedied this, by generously providing
for his brother, and entreating his Agatha to allow him still a
home at the castle: which being granted, Eustace, though still
fearful of the influence of his lovely sister, continued to
reside at home.</p>
<p>But the influence he so much dreaded during his life, became
singularly apparent after the death of his beloved John.&nbsp;
The will of the latter had indeed left an independence to
Eustace, but nothing to support the splendour of that princely
house of which he was now sole representative.&nbsp; All was
assigned to Agatha,&mdash;she was the sole <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>heir of her
husband,&mdash;the being for whose sake alone he appeared to
glory in the possession of wealth.&nbsp; Eustace indeed might
still enjoy it, but it was upon a condition which drew the blood
from the young man&rsquo;s cheek as he read, and palsied the warm
throbbings of the heart in his bosom; it was, that if John de la
Pole should die childless before he had attained the age of
thirty, Eustace should espouse the widow.&nbsp; His brother even
<i>entreated</i> this sacrifice of him: he said, he knew his
heart had been sensible of other charms, but he implored him to
yield up this transient gratification to his eternal
happiness.&nbsp; He could not endure, he said, the thought of
averting from Eustace the fortune of his house; yet still less
could he endure to know that Agatha would fill a subordinate
state in his family to that in which he had placed her.&nbsp; He
shuddered at the thought of her being driven, by this
circumstance, to become the wife of another&mdash;of one who
would love her, and whom she could also love.&nbsp; He besought
Eustace therefore, if he valued his repose, to wed her, as no
attachment subsisted between them, and he was satisfied to
believe that by him she would be treated with gentleness.&nbsp;
Agatha he entreated to comply with his last wishes, and accept
the hand of Eustace within two months after his death, or be
content to resign, with her present rank, the estates to the next
of kin.&nbsp; Such was the will of John de la Pole.&nbsp;
Eustace, full of grief, instantly retired from the castle of his
sister, whom he believed as little inclined to fulfil the
conditions of the will as himself, and resigned his spirit for
some days to despair; but his friends rallied round him, and
represented how much depended upon his calm <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>decision.&nbsp; The next of kin had appeared too, a
greedy rapacious man, the son of his father&rsquo;s sister, who
seemed to be sure of his inheritance, and who John, (it was
conjectured,) had purposely named, to stimulate his brother to
fulfil his dying injunctions.&nbsp; Hugh de Broke was insolent
and brutal, had never been on kindly terms with his cousins, and
had once nearly been murdered by the peasantry for wounding John
in a quarrel which occurred a few years before.&nbsp; The
inhabitants saw him return with disgust; his early brutalities
were remembered; and when he boasted, in his drink, that he knew
his cousin before his death intended to make a will in his
favour, all Hampshire was ready to accuse him of the murder, and
many of its gentlemen would have given half their estates to have
been able to substantiate the charge.&nbsp; From earnest desire
to action there is but one step: the thought was scarcely uttered
by one, ere many endeavoured to prove it a fact, and Hugh de
Broke became, from an object of mere dislike, one of abhorrence
and suspicion.&nbsp; He was not told of the murmurs afloat
respecting him; and he was too much accustomed to signs of
dislike, to observe any thing new in their conduct.&nbsp; The
eyes that glared upon him had nothing in them peculiarly
ferocious to him now; nor did the deep mutterings and suppressed
curses as he passed, startle him at this period from his path; he
remembered the hatred of other days, and if he <i>did</i> observe
any increase of this ill feeling towards him, he attributed their
malignity less towards himself in his own person, than against
the authority he would be enabled to hold over their actions as
the fortunate heir of John de la Pole.&nbsp; At all events, he
fortified himself <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>against their inflictions, by resorting in some cases
to the exercise of his native brutality, in others to a loud and
bitter scorn, which only served to increase their abhorrence and
his own unsuspected danger.</p>
<p>The accusers were wary in their proceedings, and silently went
on collecting proofs and accumulating evidence, until they
believed they had truly in the ruffian kinsman, discovered the
murderer of their popular favourite.&nbsp; It was remembered,
that after three years&rsquo; absence, he had appeared in
Hampshire about a month previous to the murder of John, and then
had suddenly disappeared, to re-appear as suddenly in Winchester
after the contents of the extraordinary will were made
public.&nbsp; He had boasted a previous knowledge of this
document, and he had taken into his service the man who attended
John in his fatal journey, and who, by delaying to follow his
master, had given courage to the assassin to make the
attack.&nbsp; This man had been dismissed by Eustace with a
bitter reproof, and had immediately repaired to De Broke.&nbsp;
Fear, or too much security, (it was affirmed,) had dictated the
measure of his adoption, after a dismissal which ought to have
rendered his services every where suspicious.&nbsp; John, it was
urged, had been absent nearly a month, on a visit to a distant
friend; he had set out on foot on his return, unaccompanied; for
this man, according to his own statement, was commanded by his
master to follow him with the horses, one of which (De la
Pole&rsquo;s) had been injured by an accident a few days before;
but he had loitered long after, in order to keep an appointment
which he had made with a damsel in the establishment of his
master&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; He <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>was for this loudly accused of
treachery; and De Broke ferociously became his champion, with a
violence that only defeated the object he had in view.&nbsp; The
lock of hair found in the gripe of the corpse was remembered and
produced; it was a bunch of thick and clustering curls, and had
been forcibly torn from the head of the assassin.&nbsp; The hair
of the servant was pale, but it was remarked that Hugh&rsquo;s
was dark and curling, and they sought an opportunity to compare
them together.&nbsp; De Broke drove the party from his presence
with every mark of contempt, and hardly deigned to assent to the
repeated asseverations of his servants, that his hair was much
darker, and altogether of a different texture from that produced
as taken from the corpse.&nbsp; His conduct was resented
warmly.&nbsp; By degrees all the gentry assumed the opinions of
the mob; and when, in a violent attack upon his person, it was
discovered that his hair had lately been polled in order to
facilitate the cure of a wound, and which had hitherto been
concealed by the (then) extraordinary contrivance of a peruke,
the magistrates made open cause with the people, and Hugh was
conducted to prison.&nbsp; There his conduct was sullen and
brutal; he would give no explanation, save that the wound in his
head arose from a fall from his horse.&nbsp; He was unusually
ferocious; and considerably aggravated his case, by his constant
threats of deep and deadly vengeance against Eustace de la Pole,
who, he insisted, had conspired to cheat him of his estate, in
conjunction with his other enemies.&nbsp; Many new proofs
appeared against him, and the whole county awaited, in trembling
suspense, the event of his anticipated trial.</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>But
these anticipations were not to be gratified: a few nights before
the arrival of the judges, Hugh had contrived to escape from his
prison, and elude the vigilance of his enemies, by the aid, it
was supposed, of his servant, for he also fled the country; and
neither master nor man again fell into the hands of justice.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the interval months, the short period of
time allowed for most important considerations, were fast wearing
away; the two persons most interested in their progress had come
to no decision; and though Hugh de Broke had for the present
withdrawn his claim, yet he had heirs, who neither more delicate
nor more generous than himself, might endeavour to prove his
incapacity, and substantiate their own in place of his.&nbsp; At
all events, delays were dangerous, and the fortunes of De la Pole
were too considerable to be put to hazard.&nbsp; Eustace loved
another, and Agatha could not forget her husband; yet a
compliance with the terms of the will became an absolute
necessity.&nbsp; Though with averted hearts, they joined hands at
the earnest entreaty of friends and relatives; nor would it have
been possible to have refused, since even royal majesty evinced a
solicitude, that the great fortunes and powerful political
interest of the family should not pass into any other hands than
those of that loyal and princely blood which had hitherto held
them so nobly.&nbsp; Agatha and Eustace became man and wife, and
vowed to cherish and love each other till death.</p>
<p>But it was soon evident to all, that this was not either in
the power or inclination of the new wedded pair: a deeper sorrow
had sunk into their minds, and their calm grief was supplanted <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>by looks
and feelings of horror and despair.&nbsp; They spent much of
their time together; but their conferences seemed rather to
heighten than to soothe their mutual suffering.&nbsp; It was at
length remarked, that Eustace never passed his nights in the
chamber of his wife, but sometimes in deep groans and anguish in
the seclusion of his own apartment, or in wandering wildly
through the gloomy mazes of the forest.&nbsp; At such times a
stupor would overshadow the spirit of Agatha,&mdash;a silent and
uncomplaining madness that seemed to render her insensible to
suffering; and only upon his return did she vent her keen anguish
in words, or dissipate her torture by shrieks as piercing as they
were fearful.</p>
<p>Those about them saw no other cause for this mental hell, than
the grief that had seized upon them, by constantly contemplating
their eternal separation from the being they most loved.&nbsp; It
was anticipated that time would effect, if not a cure, at least
some amelioration of its bitterness; but time rolled on, and
their agonies did not decrease.&nbsp; Nor did the prospect of an
heir to their disastrous union afford any pleasure or consolation
to their minds; they went through the usual routine of
preparation, because, as it appeared, it <i>was</i> usual; there
was no joyous anticipation on the part of Eustace,&mdash;no
tender, trembling hope on the side of Agatha; there was no
anxiety, no care; it was a thing unspoken of, unnoted; and when
the bustle of the house, the importance of the attendants, and
the entrance of the friend (who, unsummoned, save by the
servants, yet judged it necessary to be near her,) told Eustace
of the near approaching throes of Agatha, he <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>threw
himself upon the ground in the chamber adjoining her, and buried
his face in his hands.</p>
<p>Eustace, young, beautiful, and of a gallant spirit, was adored
by his household, <i>all</i> the members of which fondly
contemplated the birth of an heir, as an event well calculated to
calm their mutual suffering, and endear them to each other: and
though the maternal anguish of Agatha took place before the usual
and expected time, the hopes so affectionately cherished were not
shaken by the event; but the conduct of their master gave a wound
to their generous devotion.&nbsp; Sad and singular as it was,
that of Agatha was scarcely less inexplicable: no groans, no
tokens of pain accompanied her physical suffering; and it was
apparent that some keener pang of the mind, some woe too deep for
utterance, had deadened all sense to merely corporal pain.&nbsp;
Her eyes were generally closed, except when some louder noise, or
the nearer approach of an attendant towards the couch, forced her
to open them, and gaze around her for an instant; but, when her
senses were thus for a moment awakened, it was evident the object
which had aroused them had no share in their attention.&nbsp;
Heedless of all that was passing, she took a shuddering rapid
glance around the chamber, as if in earnest search of one whom
she yet feared to encounter, and then closed them in evident
affright, and sunk anew into stupor and silence;&mdash;it was
amidst this stupor and silence that her first-born son entered
the world.</p>
<p>Eustace had not long remained absorbed in his own painful
meditations, ere a mighty shriek from the chamber of Agatha broke
upon his ear, and made him partly raise his head from the hard
pillow to which he had consigned it.&nbsp; But his <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>soul was
dead within him;&mdash;he thought no further agony could reach
him now&mdash;no keener pang could inflict a wound in his already
crushed heart; and though the scream was one of horror and
dismay, a sound of many voices in grief and consternation, it
passed over his senses without further notice, and he again
dropped his head to the ground, and, grovelling to earth, seemed
as he would bury himself from his anguish in the kindly bosom of
his only parent&mdash;his last&mdash;his truest friend.</p>
<p>But repose was not for him&mdash;no, not even the repose of
despair&mdash;he was again to wake, to feel, to suffer; there was
an undreamed-of agony near&mdash;a sting that was to penetrate
his palsied bosom, and awake his crushed soul from the dead; to
die would have been bliss, but that was a bliss denied him.</p>
<p>The unhappy young man arose;&mdash;a footstep was heard
hastily rushing towards his chamber&mdash;the wife of Courtenay
approached him with a look of commiserating regard, and took his
arm to draw him to the apartment of Agatha.&nbsp; She did not
speak, but Eustace read in the expression of her features that
there was yet more to encounter and to endure.&nbsp; He entered
the apartment of his wife&mdash;<i>she</i> was lying speechless
and insensible upon her couch, utterly incapable of any
observation of what was passing around her; and by her side lay a
deformed and distorted infant, plunged in the still deeper
silence of death.</p>
<p>In the first moment of sorrow, the friend who had so hastily
sought the presence of Eustace, had done so under the compelling
influence of the circumstance and the time; but a few moments had
scarcely elapsed, ere Courtenay recovered sufficient <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>recollection to decide that his wife had judged
unwisely in so rapidly flying from the chamber of the poor
Agatha, and bursting into that of her husband, dreading the
influence the sudden grief might probably acquire over the
already racked brain of the latter.&nbsp; With this feeling,
Courtenay raised his eyes from the dead child to observe the
countenance of Eustace, and if possible, form a judgment as to
how he was likely to support this shock: but here his fears gave
place to a new feeling, and his grief was overpowered by
astonishment at the singular deportment of Eustace: the childless
father advanced slowly towards the corse of his infant, and gazed
upon it intently for a moment; a spasm of agony passed over his
countenance, but there was no surprise mingled with its
expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;And is it indeed <i>thus</i>!&rdquo; he
murmured in a low and agonised tone of voice; &ldquo;and
<i>so</i> must my punishment begin!&mdash;yet better is it even
thus, than that thou, poor distorted thing! shouldst live to
reproach thy father, and, by thy sufferings, be an accusing
witness against him.&rdquo;&nbsp; A convulsive shivering seized
upon his frame, and he seemed to be struggling with some
difficult and awful resolve.&nbsp; At that moment a similar
convulsion appeared to extend itself to the body of the infant;
its eyes rolled, and one arm suddenly stretched itself out with a
convulsive kind of movement, and remained extended, pointing
towards Eustace.&nbsp; The struggle was at an end in an instant;
the change from distracted to subdued sorrow was the work of a
moment.&nbsp; He grew perfectly calm; and turning his looks again
towards the infant, and addressing it in a low steady voice,
&ldquo;I thank thee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for this warning;
thou too shalt not have cause to reproach me; I have hesitated <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>too long;
but his will and thine shall be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Saying thus,
his head drooped upon his bosom as in deep thought, and the
extended arm of the child a moment after fell quietly down by its
side.</p>
<p>Courtenay, the friend of Eustace, and the near relative of
Agatha, now judged that in this moment of calmness he might
venture some expressions of consolation.&nbsp; He deeply
regretted that he should have mistaken the sleep of the infant
for the last slumber of death, and he urged to Eustace the
possibility that the union of medical skill and paternal care
might relieve his child from its afflictions, and restore it, in
natural beauty, to his love.&nbsp; He continued to dwell some
time longer upon well intended topics of consolation, until he
perceived that Eustace no longer heard his observations, or even
remembered his presence.&nbsp; Suddenly, a new thought appeared
to awaken the dormant faculties of the latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has
Agatha seen her child?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the wife of Courtenay; &ldquo;she was
insensible at the time of its birth, and I instantly rushed from
the chamber to seek counsel of my husband: he could give none;
but, terrified as myself, followed me hither.&nbsp; Now, I deem,
that as the child has uttered no sound since it came into the
world, it were better she were told of its death; it will be but
an anticipation of what must happen; for surely such an unhappy
object cannot long exist.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not
that,&rdquo; observed Eustace, sadly; &ldquo;but at least do as
thou hast said, and remove the child from the
castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Courtenay retired from the apartment; and
the wish of De la Pole was speedily obeyed.</p>
<p>But it seemed as if this unmeasured sorrow had brought
calmness to him whom they feared it <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>would annihilate: he sought not the
apartment of his wife, but retired tranquilly to his own; and
there was a stillness in it throughout the night, wholly unlike
the restless pacings and disturbed groans which had hitherto been
heard to issue from it.&nbsp; In the morning he went to Agatha;
their conference was long and sad, for traces of tears were on
her countenance when they parted; but the shrieks and agonies
which had formerly distinguished their interviews were no more;
she had caught consolation and fortitude from him, and her mind,
it appeared, had now grown as resigned and tranquil as his
own.</p>
<p>Eustace made a journey to a distant part of the country: he
spoke nothing of his intention previous to his setting out, nor
of its object on his return; that it had been of importance,
could only be collected from the care with which he had concealed
it, and the continual occupations which followed his arrival at
Winchester.&nbsp; He was constantly employed in writing, and once
or twice had had earnest conversations with Courtenay.&nbsp; It
was during one of these that he received an unexpected
interruption in the person of Agatha, who entered calmly the
apartment of her husband, and demanded his attention.&nbsp;
Courtenay arose, and was preparing to retire, when Agatha
arrested his steps.&nbsp; &ldquo;That which I have to say is for
thy ear also,&rdquo; she remarked; &ldquo;stay, therefore, and
answer me.&nbsp; Sleeping on my couch in the midday heat the
voice of my damsels in discourse broke upon my ear, and the sound
they uttered gave me to know that my infant boy yet lives;
wherefore is it that it is not in the bosom of its mother? and
why was it ever banished from her care?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a
dead silence at the conclusion of this speech.&nbsp; <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>Eustace
replied not, and the lip of Courtenay trembled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eustace fears to reply,&rdquo; observed Agatha; &ldquo;he
trembles to accumulate more sorrow upon this drooping head; he
may, in tenderness, deceive; but thou, Courtenay, knowest not to
lie, and from thy lips must the bitter truth come; wherefore is
my infant not here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We feared it would
die,&rdquo; answered Courtenay; &ldquo;and, therefore, in thy
already terrible agony, wished to spare thee the spectacle of its
dissolution.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But it did not die,&rdquo;
pertinaciously resumed Agatha; &ldquo;why was it not restored? it
might have brought peace and consolation to the bosom of its
mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; returned the
shuddering speaker; &ldquo;that child would have brought sorrow
and dismay, but no joy to the heart of its unhappy parent.&nbsp;
We removed it to a distance, fearing the effect of its appearance
upon your mind; it is most fearfully disfigured.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Disfigured!&rdquo; repeated Agatha, with a thrilling
start.&nbsp; A long pause ensued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let her behold the
boy,&rdquo; said Eustace, calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes! let me behold
my boy,&rdquo; said the mother, while tears of sorrow heightened
the lustre of those splendid eyes; &ldquo;let me behold my boy; I
shall not shrink from his sight, even though he be an eternal
remembrancer of&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused, and sadly turned
her eyes towards her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, thou hast
anticipated aright,&rdquo; said Eustace; &ldquo;he <i>will</i> be
to thee an eternal remembrancer; to me&mdash;that ghastly
face&mdash;that pointing hand&mdash;I will not behold them; yet
do I rejoice in thy resolve, for such is thy painful duty, and
thus wilt thou share my sacrifice without enduring my
suffering.&rdquo;&nbsp; He retired as he spoke; and soon after,
conducted by Courtenay, <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>in silence and secrecy, the hapless
mother folded the ghastly boy to her breast.</p>
<p>It is rare that the human mind can dwell upon more than one
wonder at a period.&nbsp; The neighbourhood, roused by the idle
gossiping of the castle damsels, had begun to be astonished at
the disappearance of the heir of De la Pole, who was said not to
be dead, but deprived of his mother&rsquo;s tenderness and his
father&rsquo;s succession; and, offended that there should be a
secret, they determined that rendering justice to the injured
child should be the apology for their own ungenerous
curiosity.&nbsp; From this they were diverted by a singular
incident.</p>
<p>A meeting of the gentlemen of the county had been called for
some public purpose foreign to this narrative.&nbsp; In the midst
of this discussion, it was observed that Eustace de la Pole was
absent: this, to many who had known of his recent griefs and
habits, was nothing singular; but those who resided more remote
from the sphere of his influence, felt authorised to demand his
presence and attention in a matter which was supposed deeply to
interest the class to which he belonged.&nbsp; A messenger was
despatched to request his attendance, and was told that he was
preparing to wait upon them; and he who was charged with the
embassy had scarcely returned to his employers, ere Eustace de la
Pole entered the council-chamber, leading by the hand a tall and
graceful youth, whom he placed at the table of the council, and
behind whose chair he stood while he spoke.&nbsp; His words were
few; but their stunning import threw horror and astonishment over
the noble assembly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I present to you this young
man,&rdquo; calmly said he; &ldquo;and I have assigned to him his
appointed place; mine it must be no longer; he is the son of Hugh
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>de
Broke, who is lately dead, and who, a few months since, was
accused of the murder of John de la Pole.&nbsp; I come to render
him a late, though, I trust, not useless justice, and restore the
honour of his house.&nbsp; This youth is not only the heir of the
fortunes of De la Pole, but of his father&rsquo;s innocence,
since I only was the murderer of my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would not be possible to paint all the feelings of the
audience who listened to this singular declaration, nor the
contrariety of opinions that pervaded the minds of men upon its
disclosure.&nbsp; Some asserted that derangement had fastened
upon the mind of Eustace, and that he only imagined the fact;
others, that grief had wearied him of existence, and that,
preferring to die by other hands than his own, he had chosen this
method of escaping from life and its convulsions; but the far
greater part (as is ever the case in human judgments) decided for
the darker side of the question, and concluded the
self-accusation to be just, and were only now interested in
analysing his motive.&nbsp; The will of the victim too became a
subject of infinite wonder; and when, to every interrogatory
(save those which implied the participation of Agatha, which he
instantly and earnestly denied,) Eustace remained mute,
indignation supplied the place of pity; and among those who had
been his intimates and friends, had eaten of his bread and drank
of his cup, there were not wanting some, who, baffled in their
eager pursuit of the marvellous, and offended that a secret was
denied to them, even hinted at the torture, as a means of
compelling a discovery of his motives and accomplices.</p>
<p>There are many whose sickly existences find <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>health only
in the contemplation of the severer agonies of others; many who,
without either hatred or malignity, yet love to feed their
unnatural and craving appetites for singularities and horrors;
and would rather cherish them with the blood of a dear friend,
than suffer them to famish for want of sustenance.&nbsp; In small
communities and country places, this inclination in the
inhabitants is most apparent: here it was cruelly visible.&nbsp;
John de la Pole had always been a popular man, and his destiny
had afforded them a feast of blood, for which they felt grateful
to his memory; from his murderer they could exact it, and they
would: the loudest for justice appealed to the king for the
application of the torture, and those who pitied the sufferer did
not oppose the petition, as curious to behold the result.</p>
<p>The weak and inquisitive prince who then filled the English
throne, saw something singular and mysterious in the conduct of
the young De la Pole, and therefore unhesitatingly gave his
assent to the sentence of his judges.&nbsp; The torture was borne
by Eustace without a groan, though a close imprisonment of some
weeks might have weakened his spirit and exhausted his bodily
strength.&nbsp; He walked calmly and unsupported to the scene of
suffering, conversing steadily with Courtenay, who never for an
instant forsook him.&nbsp; From any outward tokens of anticipated
agony or terror, it would have been difficult to distinguish the
criminal from the spectator: he even smiled as he recognised his
acquaintances in the crowd assembled to gaze upon his
sufferings.&nbsp; There was only one action remarkable in his
bearing at this trying juncture; on ascending the scaffold, and
while they were binding his arms, his attention was <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>arrested
apparently by some object near him, though no one could be seen
by the crowd, and during the whole period of the infliction of
the &ldquo;peine forte et dure,&rdquo; the victim kept his eyes
still fastened upon this spot, but without articulating a
word.&nbsp; When the accumulated weights pressed so heavily on
his sinking breast as to threaten dissolution, he raised his head
to look upon his mangled limbs, and surveyed them in silent
attention; he then turned his eyes to the spot which had so long
occupied their regards, and, pointing with a slow and solemn
motion to the load upon his breast, said, in a clear and steady
tone, &ldquo;Thou see&rsquo;st!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eustace was remanded to prison; his friends, his enemies,
those who were neither, all besought him with equal earnestness
not to die with this secret sin upon his heart; he smiled at
their anxiety, but answered nothing to their queries;&mdash;they
doubted his guilt, ascribed his conduct to madness, to
despair;&mdash;he replied by throwing off his cap and showing the
scar in his head, from which his brother, in the last agonising
grasp of death, had torn the dark and bloody lock which had once
so nearly condemned the unfortunate De Broke,&mdash;and they were
silenced.&nbsp; He continued steadfast to his
purpose&mdash;silent, sorrowful, but calm.</p>
<p>And where was Agatha during these scenes of insult and
endurance?&nbsp; Had she too forsaken the dungeon of her husband,
and given up her soul to exultation in his captivity and
anguish?&nbsp; She had once, and only once, demanded admittance
to his prison; she had remained with him many hours, and retired,
like himself, tranquillised from the interview.&nbsp; Soon after,
she formally <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>resigned the castle and its dependencies to him whom
Eustace had named as the lawful heir: her own son and his claims,
were now no longer remembered, since the crime of his father had
deprived him of the succession, which had been awarded by the
king to the son of the injured De Broke.&nbsp; After these
arrangements, which were performed in silence and celerity, and
with only the casual assistance of Courtenay, Agatha withdrew
from her native town, and concealed her person and her sorrow for
ever from the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>But her desertion of her husband at the tremendous juncture
when he so much needed her help and consolation, was not regarded
with indignation by the many who considered the circumstances
under which she stood: <i>that</i> husband was a murderer, and of
whom?&nbsp; The terrible question needed no reply, and Agatha was
speedily acquitted! her absence too was a trivial circumstance
compared with that of her husband&rsquo;s situation.&nbsp; All
eyes were turned to the prison at Winchester.</p>
<p>At length Eustace de la Pole was led out to die.&nbsp; It was
a splendid day in the season of autumn, on which his mortal
career was to terminate.&nbsp; Consideration for the princely
blood which flowed in his veins, had forbidden, in his case, the
strangulation by the degrading cord, and the axe and the block
had been substituted in its room.&nbsp; The novelty of the
circumstance drew many thousands round the scaffold, who awaited,
in feverish and almost angry impatience, the arrival of him who
was to furnish forth the spectacle of the day.&nbsp; He
came,&mdash;not indeed as before, with an erect and unassisted
step, for his <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>limbs had been crushed, and his physical strength
destroyed; but his pale countenance was composed, and his soft
rich voice was steady and clear, as he conversed at intervals
with Courtenay, the priest, and the executioner, who received him
courteously, as, led by the two former, he ascended the steps of
the scaffold.&nbsp; Of the crowd around he took no heed, but with
calm and silent celerity prepared himself for the block.&nbsp; At
sight of the noble young man, bare-headed and disrobed for the
sad and ignominious death, there were many who could no longer
restrain their tears; and hard-hearted grey-headed men who,
hating his crime, believed they could find pleasure in his
sorrow, and went thither to feast upon his suffering, now wept
loudly for him whom, in their first feeling of horror, they had
cursed.&nbsp; He appeared unconscious of this change of temper,
and seemed rather disposed to hasten than to retard the
preparations, for he laid his head down upon his last pillow
before the executioner had entirely completed them.&nbsp; He had
himself promised to give the signal for the fall of the axe; and
while the multitude were anxiously awaiting this movement, they
beheld him suddenly raise his head from the block, and gaze
intently upon one particular spot upon the scaffold; all eyes
were instantly directed towards it, but to them at least no
object was visible.&nbsp; He gazed for a few moments with intense
earnestness, then calmly replacing his head upon the block,
exclaimed in solemn but eager accents, &ldquo;Thou
see&rsquo;st!&rdquo; and gave the signal for his death.&nbsp; The
axe fell&mdash;heavily, rapidly&mdash;it was over&mdash;swifter
than thought.&nbsp; The executioner held up the gory head to the
people; the features were calm, the eyes <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>closed; but
before he could utter the customary sentence, they had once more
opened and fixed themselves upon the same spot which had
attracted the last of their living regards; they appeared slowly
to follow the movement of some unseen object round the scaffold,
till they reached the opposite side; then they withdrew their
gaze, quivered for an instant, dropped, dark and immoveable, for
ever.</p>
<p>This, as many strange scenes, was however doomed to be
forgotten, like other things.&nbsp; Ten years passed away, and
ten other wonders had, during that period, interested or
frightened the people of Winchester and its surrounding
country.&nbsp; John and Eustace de la Pole were no more
remembered, or their story only casually mentioned as belonging
to the odd things that were; Courtenay had glided into middle
age, and the youth for whom Eustace had done so much, had long
since written man.&mdash;Ten years!&nbsp; How many and how
striking may be the changes of ten years!&nbsp; Courtenay had
long pondered over the destiny of Agatha, and sighed to think
whither her unhappy fate might have conducted her; but the long
interval which passed had almost swept her from his mind, when a
letter, in her unforgotten character, was one day put into his
hand.&nbsp; It was couched in brief and anxious terms, and
conveyed a request that he would immediately proceed to her
dwelling.&nbsp; Courtenay was no laggard in the cause of
humanity; he did not pause to speculate upon this address, or
even to wonder at its abruptness, but he set forward instantly,
and the morning of the following day saw him knock at a lonely
cottage on the coast of Dorsetshire, in the neighbourhood of
Corfe Castle.&nbsp; <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>The door was opened by Agatha
herself, who habited in the black robes which she had worn since
the sad death of the last of her husbands, received him with
courteous sadness.&nbsp; Years had not dimmed the beauty of her
matchless face, but sorrow had been busy with its expression; the
same lovely features were there, but their once bright character
was gone.</p>
<p>Their meeting was tenderly sorrowful: Agatha said little in
explanation until she had conducted her guest into an adjoining
chamber, and pointed out one object for his observation.&nbsp;
Stretched upon a couch, grown to boyhood, covered with wounds,
and unchanged in person, save that his deformities had now grown
more manifest, lay extended the ghastly boy, the only child of
Agatha and the helpless Eustace.&nbsp; Courtenay trembled as he
gazed; but the mother&rsquo;s looks were calm.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
dead,&rdquo; she said, on observing the emotion of her guest;
&ldquo;what Heaven and Nature with so much difficulty spared, the
brutality of man has destroyed; he was my joy and sorrow, and
many a weary hour have I watched to snatch him from the yawning
grave: for ten years he has been my sole care; and for the
insults and scorn heaped upon his deformed and idiotic existence,
he found compensation in the tenderness of his mother.&nbsp; The
small pittance which I derived from my father was sufficient for
our wants; and never should I have called upon any former friend,
but for the cruel deed of yesterday; robbers from the waters
broke into my dwelling, and pillaged thence my property.&nbsp; I
knew not how it was; I had gone to a distance to buy food, and on
my return found the poor idiot thus.&nbsp; My only <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>attendant,
an old woman, had been wounded in his defence; and from her I
with difficulty learned, that the convulsive movements of the
boy, and his pointing hand, as his menacing eye followed their
actions, had drawn upon him their wrath and its brutal
consequences.&nbsp; I am averse from again appearing in the
scenes which I have once and for ever abandoned, and therefore I
sent for thee, Courtenay, to spare myself the sad task of
interring the pale corpse of my boy, and drawing wondering and
inquisitive eyes upon my person and history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtenay was pleased with the confidence reposed in his
friendship.&nbsp; A brother&rsquo;s love might have done less for
Agatha; it could not have effected more.&nbsp; Her wishes were
immediately performed; and he was preparing, with unintrusive
delicacy, to return to his home, when Agatha for a few moments
detained him; &ldquo;You have deserved unlimited confidence at my
hands,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and you shall obtain it: he who is
now numbered with the ignominious dead desired it should be so,
and I withhold it no longer.&nbsp; You, in common with all the
world, were ignorant of the motives which impelled the unhappy
Eustace to the deed which he perpetrated; but you did not, in
common with all the world, forsake him in his utmost need: for
you he drew up the story of his sorrows, and placed it in my
hands to be given to you only when I saw the fitting time; that
time hath arrived.&nbsp; The child of sorrow is dead, and I shall
still more completely retire from a world where insignificance
and poverty are no protection from cruelty and avarice; a convent
will shortly receive me, and, if I continue to live, a newer and
better existence will be mine: if not, I <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>shall have
done wisely in thus obeying the last command of
Eustace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtenay received the packet and retired; he lingered not a
moment to relieve the recluse of his presence, but returned to
Winchester, after receiving her commands to see her again in
three days: he then hastened to his apartment, and, with
trembling avidity, read, in the confessions of Eustace, the
secret story of the fortunes of De la Pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that thou despisest me, Courtenay; I know that
thou deemest me no less a fool than a coward; thou didst bring me
the means of an honourable death, gavest into mine hands the
dagger and the drug, and I have rejected both: we disputed,
differed, parted, met again, and again renewed the subject; thou
didst even deign to persuade the coward (so thou thoughtest him)
to act like a man; but thy entreaties were unheeded and thy
counsel rejected: he will die like a thief and a
criminal&mdash;he will be hooted out of life; and curses will be
the torches to give light to his memory, that it sink not into
darkness and oblivion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said I not that I was a sacrifice? that my punishment
was a propitiatory offering?&nbsp; Now again I say to thee the
same thing.&nbsp; Death would have few horrors for me (for it is
a thing I covet) without the ignominy of a public execution; to
offer my life for my wrong would be nothing, but to offer it up
thus!&mdash;This alone can satisfy immortal justice; this alone
can satisfy the spirit of the murdered man.&nbsp; Read and behold
the meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest how fondly, contrary to his father&rsquo;s
hope, John de la Pole loved the beautiful <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>daughter of
Philip Forester, thy kinsman; but thou knowest not how much more
fervently she was adored by the wretched Eustace, and how
tenderly the gentle Agatha returned that love.&nbsp; Hope there
was none; for what had I to bribe the greedy father of my love,
when John de la Pole could hereafter lay the fortunes of his
house at her feet?&nbsp; Philip suspected the state of his
daughter&rsquo;s heart, and had looked deeper than I imagined
into mine: he determined that a younger brother was not deserving
of his Agatha&rsquo;s beauty, and, by cold civilities and hints
of my father&rsquo;s and brother&rsquo;s disapprobation, banished
me from his house.&nbsp; One thing alone gave consolation to my
blighted heart, the steadiness with which my father resolved
against the marriage of John with the object of our mutual
passion.&nbsp; In one of the sad conferences which I
occasionally, though now but seldom, held with my beloved Agatha,
it occurred to my imagination, that though my father had resolved
to dispose differently of the heir of his house, he might not
object to my union with the object of my choice; and I received
permission of my beloved to make the attempt upon his
feelings.&nbsp; I did so immediately, and, with a rapture which I
dare not now dwell upon, received his permission, and his solemn
promise to purchase the approbation of the selfish Forester, by
bestowing upon me one-fourth of his more than princely
fortune.&nbsp; He arranged to see Forester upon the following
day: the same evening I flew to Agatha.&nbsp; O Courtenay! didst
thou ever love?&nbsp; Those few blessed hours were the most happy
of my life, and the last that were so.&nbsp; We parted; Agatha
radiant with happiness; I, to think, to hope, to anticipate, to
wish all things <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>could share my transports, to love creation, to love
God.&nbsp; In the morning my father was found dead on his couch;
and the following month Agatha became the wife of my
brother!&nbsp; Courtenay! didst thou ever love?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt ask, where was Eustace when his beloved was
thus sacrificed?&nbsp; Alas! sent to a distance, to execute some
commands of that brother upon whom I was so utterly
dependent.&nbsp; He had discovered my love, and thus, without my
suspecting his intentions, prevented its consequences: he
hastened to Agatha, represented the ruin she would bring upon me,
and his determination to abandon me for ever, unless she became
his wife; Forester, who was his ally, threatened her with his
curse; I know not all the artifices used,&mdash;I never could
listen to the detail.&nbsp; She became the wife of the man she
could not love, and I was suffered to wither beneath his roof,
while, with calm hypocrisy, he told his own tale, ostentatiously
enriched his younger brother, and declared he could not live
happy without him.&nbsp; Fool that he was!&mdash;stupid,
uncalculating idiot!&nbsp; He had torn asunder two burning
hearts, and expected to smother their fires; he had separated two
devoted beings, compelled them to live in each other&rsquo;s
presence, and yet expected them to forget.&nbsp; Agatha abhorred
his sight&mdash;his very aspect was loathsome to her.&nbsp; I saw
her agonies,&mdash;I saw her daily shudderings at every
demonstration of his love; and cold dews of death spread over my
own heart when I beheld her submitting to his fondness.&nbsp; I
implored to be banished from the castle; I entreated to be
allowed the sad privilege of beholding Agatha no more: he could
not trust me from him, he said; <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>and I was obliged to remain.&nbsp;
Merciless idiot! blind looker into the human heart!&nbsp; Had he
consented, all might then have been well; but how did he dare
thus selfishly sport with torture?&nbsp; He went on a journey for
a few weeks; he commanded me to a distant part of the country on
business of importance to his interests: I went, but returned ere
half the allotted time for his absence had expired&mdash;to be
alone with Agatha&mdash;to see her unrestrained&mdash;to mingle
my tears with hers: I could not resist this one sad bliss, and I
hastened back to enjoy it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We met, the lover and the beloved, in grief&mdash;in
madness&mdash;in despair!&nbsp; Oh, wonder not, that when we
parted guilt should be added to the burthen of our sorrows; but
the terrible consciousness of crime changed at once our natures
and our deeds.&nbsp; Agatha&rsquo;s horror of her husband
increased: and, now that she was mine, I determined she should no
more be his&mdash;to fly, and rob the castle for the means of
sustenance.&nbsp; Alas! I feared to expose her to scorn, should
we be unable to evade the pursuit of justice; and, even if in
this we should succeed, what means had I of subsistence when that
slender source should fail, proscribed, as we should be, in every
part of our native land?&nbsp; To live on, as I had lately done,
was still more impossible; since Agatha herself had armed her
bosom with a knife to be turned against her heart rather than
again endure the horrors of her husband&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Again
and again we met in passionate, though gloomy conference; and
thus continued to waste the time in fruitless debate until his
messenger announced his approaching return.&nbsp; Despair gave
wings to my thought; Agatha&rsquo;s eye glanced on mine; she drew
the dagger <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>from her breast, and I snatched it from her hand.&nbsp;
Our thoughts had spoken&mdash;there was no need of words&mdash;we
had understood each other without them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hastened to conceal myself in the New Forest, near
the road through which he must pass on his return.&nbsp; He had
taken his confidential servant with him, and, rather than expose
myself to observation, I had determined to fire at him through
the trees, calculating and believing that the servant would
mistake the attack for that of concealed robbers, and fly,
leaving his master to his fate.&nbsp; But I had scarcely arranged
my mode of attack ere I heard a footstep in the road; I looked
out, and beheld him slowly advancing, with his eyes steadfastly
directed towards the towers of his castle, as if he sought out
the apartment of his wife.&nbsp; At the sight of him all prudence
vanished&mdash;all recollection of the calm attack which I had
meditated passed away from my mind; I did not even observe that
he was alone: hatred and rage filled my heart, and I rushed upon
him like a wild beast, tearing him to the earth by the bare
strength of sinew, and inflicting many mortal stabs upon his
breast: he grappled fiercely with me, struggled hard to rise, and
even drew his dagger, which I broke in his grasp before he could
strike one blow.&nbsp; He tore a lock of hair from my head, but,
during the terrible contest he had not uttered a single word,
till a deep and home-directed stroke upon his brow threw him
powerless on the sod, then he spoke gaspingly to his brother:
&lsquo;Have mercy upon me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;have mercy; I
have wronged thee, but that is not the heaviest of my crimes; I
would live to repent: to expiate one, the deepest, darkest, let
me live; <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>I dare not die.&nbsp; My father!&mdash;I overheard his
arrangements with thee&mdash;I could not bear to lose&mdash;he
was found dead on his couch&mdash;I smothered him in the
night.&nbsp; Mercy, mercy!&nbsp; O Eustace! let me live,&mdash;I
am not fit to die!&rsquo;&nbsp; But his words raised a wilder
fiend in my soul, that scared away the spirit of mercy.&nbsp; He
then had been the monster&mdash;he!&mdash;I raved aloud,
&lsquo;Murderer! thou art not fit to live&mdash;hell gapes for
thee&mdash;begone!&rsquo;&nbsp; I drew my dagger across his
throat; the blood gushed upon my face, upon my hands; he grinned,
scowled, gibbered as he sunk, but he spoke and struggled no
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hastened home,&mdash;but I saw not Agatha, neither
did I seek her during the long and terrible night that followed
the sunset crime: I dared not tell her what I had done; I could
not have borne to hear her speak of the sin which I had
committed.&nbsp; Towards the morning I grew calm; my fears and
horror subsided; I thought of the atrocious act of the guilty
dead, and, by degrees, persuaded myself that I had done an act of
justice; I began to calculate upon the consequences, and
seriously consider whether, by this deed, I had really achieved
the consummation of my wishes&mdash;the possession of my adored
Agatha; she was my sister, the widow of my brother; could I
legally become her husband?&nbsp; And, allowing the possibility,
was it probable that I should be permitted to do so?&nbsp; These
considerations gave birth to the action which followed; I forged
the extraordinary will which gave the succession to me, but only
with the hand of Agatha; and it appeared the more natural, as,
during the period of her wedlock, she had borne no child to her
husband.&nbsp; That night and succeeding day was thus intently
occupied.&nbsp; <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>On the following morning the corpse was discovered by
you.&nbsp; I had not seen Agatha, but, on hearing of her meeting
the body, hastened to calm her mind, and prepare her for the
will, which was opened after the interment.&nbsp; I made use of
the pretext of another love, to appear repugnant to the wishes of
my brother, and quitted the castle to appease the inquietudes of
Agatha, who entreated me not to see her again until I could make
her my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the reading of that will; you remember the
arrival of De Broke; poor wretch! his drunken falsehoods, his
silly boasts, and above all, his ungoverned insolence, has cost
him fatally dear.&nbsp; I was not concerned at the suspicion
which fell upon him; on the contrary, I rejoiced it had found
such an object; but I trembled with horror when I beheld him
conducted to a dungeon, and reflected on the probability of his
paying the penalty of my crime.&nbsp; Guilty enough already, this
accumulation of sin appalled me, and I determined that innocent
blood at least should not cry out from earth against me.&nbsp; In
the night previous to the day fixed for his trial, which I
dreaded equally, whether he should be condemned or acquitted, I
sought his prison, and, by an exaggerated account of the popular
rage against him, prevailed upon him to accept the means of
escape; his servant who attended him, terrified by the picture I
drew of his master&rsquo;s danger, united his entreaties to
mine.&nbsp; Hugh&rsquo;s courage and fortitude gave way to our
solicitations; he fled, and preserved his life at the expense of
his honour and his peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot express to you how deep was the pang the ruin
of this man&rsquo;s character gave me, <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>nor how I
sunk from the eyes lifted to mine in commiseration, whenever his
name was mentioned before me; even now, now that I have rendered
back such severe justice, my heart sickens as I recall the curses
which I heard heaped upon his head as the murderer of John de la
Pole.&nbsp; I should have suffered less had they branded the
criminal unknown, but to hear an innocent man thus accused for
me&mdash;O Courtenay! thou knowest not, mayest thou never know,
remorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reasoned much even then upon the folly of this
conduct; I said, I am a cowardly villain, a sneaking murderer,
who fears the consequences of the crime he yet feared not to
commit.&nbsp; Why should I be careful of this man&rsquo;s life?
what is his safety to me? his death might be my security, at
least would prevent suspicion from falling elsewhere; are not his
manners brutal, his heart selfish, avaricious, and cruel? who
will miss him from the earth? and by whom will his loss be
mourned?&nbsp; But it is my crime for which he will suffer, and
the curse of innocent blood will lie upon my head: neither has he
injured me, that I should doom him so hardly: I cannot even taste
the luxury of revenge.&nbsp; These thoughts disquieted me, and,
recurring more frequently than I could bear, influenced my
conduct in regard to the prisoner.&nbsp; &lsquo;The means of
escape shall be offered to him,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;if,
innocent as he knows himself to be, he be coward enough to accept
them, he is worthy of the opprobrium which will cling to him, and
I ought not to grieve for that ruin of character which he himself
alone will effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this wretched sophistry I endeavoured <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>to
reconcile my conscience, and, strange to say, I succeeded; care
and regret departed from my bosom, and I looked forward to the
day of my approaching union with Agatha with an impatience which
I found it difficult to control: it came at length, and under
happy auspices, for all our friends were assembled around us, and
I saw in my beloved&rsquo;s tranquil smile the scarce concealed
joy of her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that day, Courtenay&mdash;you remember the
brilliant assemblage and the gay festival of night&mdash;you
remember how brightly sparkled the jest, how sweetly sounded the
song, and how every creature present seemed wrapped in the
delicious intoxication of the hour&mdash;you remember my parting
commands after Agatha had retired, to carouse till the day-break,
and make the young sun a witness of your felicity: you did so; it
was a scene of joy and splendour.&nbsp; Alas! there was another,
and a widely different, passing in a more retired part of the
castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must pause in my narrative here for a few moments;
all that has as yet been detailed has been plain and simple fact,
subject to no doubts, liable to no misconstructions; hitherto all
has been clear; that which will follow is wild, strange, and
improbable&mdash;mysterious, incomprehensible indeed, yet not
less true than that which I have hitherto written.&nbsp; How
shall I make you understand what I have to present to your
mind?&nbsp; In what words shall I clothe a narrative so
extraordinary as to prevent its stamping me with the opprobrium
of folly or madness?&nbsp; Even now, in my dying hour, on the
very steps of the scaffold, I hesitate at the thought of being
lightly esteemed by thee, or my sacrifice regarded as the result
of a <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>weakened intellect or a disordered brain: it is more
easy to die as a knave than be lamented as a fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agatha had withdrawn from the hall with her damsels,
and I hastened to follow her; she had retired to an apartment
adjoining her bridal chamber, and thither, wearied of the noise
and mirth of the rioters below, I also hastened.&nbsp; I longed
for a delight I had not lately experienced, an unreserved
conversation with my wife, and to be allowed to dismiss the
coldness which, during the day, I had been obliged to feign
towards her.&nbsp; The damsels retired, and we were left to pour
out our hearts to each other in the unbounded confidence of our
new relation, when we were startled by hearing a slow and heavy
foot steadily ascending the stairs; as these were private,
leading only to our apartments, Agatha was surprised and
offended.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who would intrude at this hour?&rsquo; she
demanded, while her eyes turned anxiously towards the door.&nbsp;
For me, a thrill of horror shot through my inmost heart; I said,
relinquishing the hand I had till then so fondly clasped in mine,
&lsquo;<i>That is the step of my brother</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was so, Courtenay: a moment more and the door
slowly opened of itself to give entrance to its master; John de
la Pole entered the room and stood between Agatha and me; his
face was as in his dying hour, ghastly and menacing, and every
gash of the murderous knife upon his body as frightfully distinct
as on the night they were inflicted.&nbsp; In one hand he held a
lock of dark hair; the other was extended threateningly towards
me; and thus he stood between us, drawn from another world by the
crime I <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>meditated against his bed, and an everlasting barrier
before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first emotion was astonishment&mdash;a boundless and
stupefied surprise&mdash;then a vague and horrid notion that my
brother was not really dead, that he had escaped alive from my
hands, and was now come to accuse and surrender me up to
scorn.&nbsp; The interval which had passed since his death was
obliterated from my mind, and I felt as if that night had been
the season of the deed.&nbsp; I spoke in extenuation of my crime,
accused his selfishness, cursed his calculating cruelty; I
implored his mercy, folded my hands in supplication, and knelt
before him in humble debasement.&nbsp; No muscle of his
countenance moved, and not a sound escaped through his bruised
and blackened lips; he did not even look upon me, but continued
to fasten his stony eyes upon the face of Agatha, who stood
silent and motionless as himself, gazing like a fascinated thing
upon this aspect of horror.&nbsp; I arose from my
knees&mdash;shut my eyes&mdash;tossed my arms abroad to the
air&mdash;endeavoured to think I was in sleep, in drunkenness, in
delirium: no, <i>he was still there</i>!&mdash;I thought of the
agony of tempestuous feeling I had endured on the night following
the commission of the crime, and, believing that my jaded mind
was suffering under the same infliction, resolved to seek my
couch, to restore my exhausted spirits by rest and sleep.&nbsp; I
made an effort to move from my place; I knew that motion might
recall my scattered senses; and I exerted myself to enter the
chamber of Agatha.&nbsp; Wilt thou believe me, Courtenay? the
stern shadow anticipated my movement, and, menacing me back,
strode silently towards my bridal chamber.&nbsp; <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>At the door
its menacing attitude towards me was changed for one of command
to Agatha; one bloody finger was raised to beckon her to follow:
she did so.&nbsp; Still stupidly insensible, gazing fixedly upon
his form, she followed the direction of his hand, and passed
after him into the chamber: the door closed upon them without a
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I began to think more calmly: the dead, cold thing
was gone, and there was life and air in the apartment; the
feelings of this world came upon me, and I became sensible of
fear.&nbsp; I was safe; but where was Agatha?&mdash;<i>he</i> had
beckoned her forth&mdash;was it reality?&mdash;she was
gone&mdash;had it been the work of imagination, she had still
been there&mdash;but she might have retired to her chamber
alone.&nbsp; This was to be ascertained.&nbsp; I attempted to
enter&mdash;the door was fast; I called upon Agatha&mdash;there
was no sound in reply; I reviewed the last scene, considered the
incidents of the past, weighed the appearances of the present,
and came at length to the terrible conclusion that a spirit of
the damned had stood before me, and that Agatha was still in his
grasp!&nbsp; You will not wonder that temporary insanity followed
this hideous idea: I grew wild at the thoughts of her danger; I
shrieked aloud for mercy; I tore my hair in agony, and beat at
the closed door with the utmost exertion of strength.&nbsp; I
wonder even now that none heard the uproar I made; but my cries
remained unanswered&mdash;no sound issued from the bridal chamber
of the dead, and I continued to rave until nature, exhausted,
sunk speechless and senseless to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning had broken over the apartment when I awoke, and
I was some moments in recovering recollection of my state and
circumstances; slowly <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>the truth came before me.&nbsp; I
was lying extended on the bare ground, the lights had burned out,
and there was no trace of visitors having been near me in my
sleep.&nbsp; I arose and listened for some sound that might
direct my first movements, for now I knew not what to think nor
to do.&nbsp; A low sobbing from the chamber of Agatha rivetted my
attention; I sprung towards the door, and, to my astonishment, it
yielded to the slightest touch: I entered; Agatha was there,
seated upon the bed, and gazing around her with a look of
agonising affright; she saw me on the instant, and rushed into my
arms.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou art here! thou art safe!&rsquo; she cried
in delirious transport; &lsquo;and for this I am at least
grateful; I deemed he had destroyed thee.&nbsp; But thou didst
leave me, Eustace.&nbsp; O quit me not, I beseech thee! save me
from him, Eustace, for thou alone canst!&rsquo;&nbsp; I
endeavoured to soothe her anguish, and, after some time,
succeeded in restoring her to tranquillity and composure enough
to be made acquainted with the real state of our circumstances;
and I implored her to inform me whither the ghastly phantom had
led her, on their retiring from the chamber.&nbsp; She shuddered
at the question, and a wild and strange expression passed over
her countenance ere she spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will tell
thee,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;yet it is but little that I have to
say.&nbsp; To this room we came, and our footsteps wandered no
further.&nbsp; Without a word he gave his commands to me, and
without a word I obeyed him.&nbsp; I ascended my bridal bed, he
had willed it so, and he continued to gaze upon me till my head
sunk upon the pillow; then the ghastly thing sat down by my side,
and though I closed mine eyes hard that I might not behold him,
yet I felt that the shadow of his unearthly <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>face was
upon me.&nbsp; Once I looked up in the hope that he was gone;
beholding him I shrunk, and would have called upon thee, but the
stony eye of the spectre grew larger, and a fiendish pang passed
over the immoveable face; then I hid mine in my mantle that I
might look upon him no more: insensibility succeeded, and I
slept; in the morning I awoke, and he was gone!&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the tale of Agatha! thou wilt doubt its truth,
nor can I wonder at thy most natural incredulity: yet I would now
give my few short hours of life, precious as they may be, that
thou hadst been present and <i>seen</i> her tell this story; I
can give thee her words, her form of expression, but what
language of mine can portray her looks as she spoke, or describe
the harrowing tones of her voice as she cried to me for
protection?&nbsp; I doubted not; for these powerful witnesses
would have carried conviction to my mind, had I not already
beheld the shadowy thing she spoke of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could I offer in consolation?&nbsp; We wept bitter
tears together, and mingled our tender grief.&nbsp; If we
indulged a momentary hope that it was but an illusion of the
brain, and would return no more, we were quickly undeceived at
the approach of night.&nbsp; Again came the ghastly shadow, and
again was the spirit of Agatha chained by the sleep of death in
his presence.&nbsp; Nor were his visitations confined to the dark
and silent hour of night; when we met in the morning, to lament
our fate and weep from our stuffed bosoms the weight that pressed
upon our hearts, then, with a hideous familiarity, he would stand
between us, mocking, with his menacing grin and uplifted finger,
the agony his presence created.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Another</i> night came; we sat alone, solitary, <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>speechless,
motionless; hour after hour passed, and we moved not, except to
cast stern regards towards the door, or listen with repressed
impatience to every sound in the castle.&nbsp; Slowly, at last,
came the step of the dead, heavily ascending the stairs;&mdash;he
entered&mdash;I rushed to meet him, and the long pent up agony of
my soul burst forth in madness uncontrolled.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Monster!&mdash;murderer!&mdash;destroyer of thy father and
thy brother! why comest thou thus to torture and not kill? why is
thy bloody hand for ever raised, and yet forbearing to
fall?&nbsp; If thine aim be vengeance,
strike&mdash;strike&mdash;strike&mdash;thou blood-bespotted
horror! and rend from hope and from life those who dared to make
thee what thou art!&mdash;Strike, thou silent, sullen thing! that
we may be as thou art, and learn to fear thee not!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I darted towards him, but was arrested by some
invisible barrier ere I had traversed half the distance between
us; I could not reach him, but sunk, as if felled by an unseen
blow, helpless and almost senseless, to the ground: <i>he</i> did
not even look upon me, but again sternly summoned Agatha from the
chamber, as nightly he had done before.&nbsp; I&mdash;but
wherefore dwell upon these agonies?&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that
these accumulated horrors at length drove me from the side of
Agatha to solitude and reflection: sorrow came upon my
soul&mdash;a sorrow less for my crime than for its fatal
consequences.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;perhaps
the tormentor is himself more keenly punished by these hauntings
than either of his shrinking victims: said he not, in the hour of
death, that he too was a murderer? and did he not pray for time
in which to expiate the sin?&nbsp; Surely, surely, these
visitations must be the hell of the parricide.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;And a feeling of remorse arose in my mind, as I
deemed it possible that these unnatural hauntings might be
involuntary.&nbsp; I had stabbed at the life of my brother, and
plunged his unprepared spirit into the hell which awaited it; and
surely a more bitter one than looking again upon the secret deeds
of the survivors, could not well be imagined.&nbsp; Agatha, too,
no longer wept over her separation from me, but hourly called
upon Heaven for pity and for pardon; madness and anguish passed
away from her heart, and sorrow and repentance entered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not repent; at least I could not feel
self-condemnation to that degree which I had been early taught
was so necessary&mdash;that perfect sorrow which abhorred the
crime and the criminal, and which, they say, is alone the gift of
Heaven&mdash;<i>that</i> I did not feel: still, still did my
inmost soul worship the thought of Agatha, and abhor the
treachery of John de la Pole.&nbsp; I could not regret that I had
avenged my wrong&mdash;I could not repent that I had attempted to
make her mine; I knew that were the deed again to do&mdash;again
should I dare, and perform it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repentance then was not mine; but I despaired of peace,
and knew how to punish crime: I was not yet weary of life; and
though tears of remorse did not fill my eyes for my
brother&rsquo;s early doom, yet his unnatural tortures now, and
Agatha&rsquo;s suffering, seemed to call for something like
justice from my hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps, in the stern mood in
which I am,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the sacrifice will be greater
than if repentance struck; and believing myself sure of
forgiveness, I hastened to make my peace with Heaven.&nbsp; Yes;
I will die&mdash;I will inflict <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>death upon myself as I would upon
another, and expiate crime with blood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hesitated still; death, contemplated so near, in
any shape, was horrible; but, dealt by the hand of the
executioner&mdash;I shrunk from the thought, and could not bear
the shadow of a stain upon the honour of my house; so I went on
from day to day, dreaming of justice but rendering none, till the
birth of Agatha&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Thou wast surprised, I
believe, at the little emotion I betrayed at its sight: alas! I
had long been prepared for some object of horror, and now it was
before me.&nbsp; Thou didst behold the action of the ghastly
child; thou sawest the menacing finger upraised towards my head,
and the calm determination with which I met this image: its
presence had banished my indecision.&nbsp; I believed now that
Agatha was lost to me for ever,&mdash;that Eternal Justice by
this sign spoke against me, and, in punishment of my hardness of
heart, had thus perpetuated the remembrance of my crime.&nbsp;
Now, then, I <i>resolved</i> to die: I communicated my purpose to
Agatha, and earthly feelings once more gained the mastery over my
subdued spirit, and burst forth in words of grief and reproach,
on observing that she evinced no horror at my approaching fate,
and scarcely attempted to dissuade me from my purpose!&nbsp;
Agatha, for whom I had dared and suffered so much&mdash;even she
had become indifferent to my destiny: it was indeed time to
die!&nbsp; But I did her wrong; sorrow had broken her heart, and
repeated scenes of horror had subdued and weakened her
spirit.&nbsp; With the feeling common to her sex, she sought
consolation only in religion, and thought that to reconcile
herself with Heaven was all that was left her <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>now: love
had fled with every other human passion, and far from regarding
death as an evil, she looked upon it as a passport to bliss, and
was more ready to rejoice at than deprecate my fate.&nbsp; Her
conduct assisted my resolution.&nbsp; Now, then, the first step
was to be made&mdash;the most difficult and appalling&mdash;the
rest would be consequential and easy.&nbsp; It was necessary to
begin, and I knew of no better mode than that of rendering
justice to the living.&nbsp; Hugh de Broke had been ruined by me,
and it was now incumbent upon me to restore him to honour and to
happiness: I set out for the distant and humble dwelling in
which, since his escape, he had been obliged to conceal his name
and dignity: he was stretched upon a sick-bed&mdash;a
heart-broken and a dying man: it was no physical disease of which
he was expiring,&mdash;but disgrace had poisoned the fountain of
his blood, and shame had eaten its way like a canker-worm to his
heart.&nbsp; When he saw me, he shook off his dying listlessness,
and sprung upright in his bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;What more wouldst
thou have, thou blaster of mine honour!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;of
a ruined and dying man?&nbsp; To thy pernicious counsel I owe the
shame no after-conduct can efface: cursed, cursed coward that I
was! why did I heed or believe thy murderous mercy?&nbsp; Begone,
wretch! and let me die.&nbsp; I cannot shake off this load of
shame, but I shall sink under its burthen, and bequeath its
remorse to thee; go, wretch! and let me die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was submissively attended by his wife and son, who
were earnest with me to relieve him of my presence.&nbsp; Sorrow,
and the near approach of death, had softened his heart and
chastised the natural brutality of his manners; he looked and
spoke more mildly to them, though, with all his <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>failing
strength, he continued to heap maledictions upon me.&nbsp; My
humiliations were now to begin; I kneeled down by his side,
detailed my crime without any palliation, asked his forgiveness
for the injury I had done him, and finished by avowing my
resolution to deliver myself into the hands of justice, and
restore his fame and happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was astonished, that during this confession no word
had been uttered by him whom it so deeply concerned.&nbsp; I
looked up to behold its effect; he was staring wildly at me, the
strong energies of his spirit struggling with the grasp of death
to gain time to hear its termination; he strove hard to
articulate something; and finally whether he conquered for some
few moments the mighty power that was wrestling with him, or that
that power had now incorporated itself with his victim, and given
him of its potency, I knew not, but he suddenly grew calm and
passionless, pain and convulsion left him, his features assumed a
pale rigidity, and his voice the solemn earnestness of the grave,
as he spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no time for question,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;but I pray that the truth may be upon thy lips:
soon, very soon, shall we meet again; and my pardon shall be
truly thine when thou shalt tell me that my boy sits with honour
in the halls of his fathers.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused, placed the
hand of his son in mine, and expired without a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What followed, I need not tell thee; the son of Hugh
was restored, and Eustace consigned to a dungeon.&nbsp; The
attempts of the people to force from me my secret, you know how I
resisted; calmly and even proudly I went to my prison and
prepared myself to die.&nbsp; I had humbled <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>myself to
De Broke, for to him I had done deep and particular injury; but
to these men I owed no other reparation than what my life would
pay: what right had they to demand further humiliation of me, or
attempt to rend from my bosom the mystery of its secret
purpose?&nbsp; I would die unaccusing, save myself; I would die,
shrouded in gloomy dignity,&mdash;a man to be wondered at and
feared, rather than pitied and scorned.&nbsp; I will willingly
furnish their greedy eyes with the awful feast of death, but not
their vulgar souls with the struggles and humiliations of mine;
my body is the law&rsquo;s&mdash;is theirs; my spirit is beyond
their judgment.&nbsp; John de la Pole shall sleep on, embalmed in
good opinions; I will not raise up his pall to show them what
corruption festers beneath it; I would not tell them what he
<i>was</i>, though it should even lessen in their thought the
horror of what I <i>am</i>.&nbsp; Grand and silent
death&mdash;majestic in thy obscurity&mdash;I wait to bid thee
welcome!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus far had I written, and thought that my story in
the book of life had come to its close, but other events have
crowded upon me; and before my death, (which will be on the
morrow,) I would tell thee the incidents of the last few
days.&nbsp; Thou knowest how calmly I beheld thee depart from my
prison, and how little emotion I manifested at my fate; but when
thou wert gone, when I was alone, in chains, degraded, the
enthusiasm of the moment past, and my spirit inactive, I wept
bitter tears at the waywardness of my early fate; yet I relaxed
not in my determination; I came hither to die, and nothing was
left me but to finish my purpose nobly.&nbsp; It is my will to
doom a murderer, and I am he so doomed.&nbsp; <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>I wept, yet
persisted; cursed the cruelty which had destroyed me, and yet
prayed to my brother for pardon.&nbsp; Of the future I had as yet
scarcely thought; hitherto I had been solely employed about the
method of quitting this world, without much considering the terms
of my admission to another; now I pondered long, with anxiety,
but not with fear.&nbsp; Creeds puzzled me&mdash;I made not my
own heart&mdash;I cannot be answerable for its opinions.&nbsp; I
have committed a deadly sin&mdash;I am about to expiate it with
my blood&mdash;I cannot do more; and is not this sacrifice
greater than the cant of sorrow and the whinings of prayer from
one who never prayed before?&nbsp; The one is from myself, the
child of my resolution&mdash;the other the offspring of
fear&mdash;But I was distracted still, and bewildered.&nbsp; It
was in this disturbed state that I was startled by a light sound
in my prison&mdash;I listened&mdash;a soft voice, for the second
time, pronounced in kindly accents, &lsquo;My
brother!&rsquo;&nbsp; I started up and gazed around me; on the
opposite side of my dungeon stood the form of John de la Pole,
but not as I had seen him last, pale, menacing, and bloody, but
with that mild aspect and gentle look that had distinguished his
early brotherhood, ere Agatha&rsquo;s fatal beauty cut asunder
the knot that bound our souls together.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou hast
done well,&rsquo; said the gentle spirit, &lsquo;thus to render
up thy life for thy crime; thy severe justice hath merited and
obtained thy pardon; my sufferings, too, the punishment for
unrepented sin, thy firmness hath terminated; and the day of
Agatha shall henceforth flow more peaceful.&nbsp; Soon shalt thou
be with me, O brother! and the kiss of immortality shall be given
to thee by my lips: weep not&mdash;doubt not&mdash;but bear all
things steadfastly; <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>in thine hour of agony I will stand
by thy side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tender grief overpowered my spirit as he spoke, and
tears fell from my eyes.&nbsp; I extended my arms as if I would
have embraced him, but the barrier between the living and the
dead could not as yet be passed, and the shadow receded from my
touch.&nbsp; But this visitation had brought joy to my heart and
tranquillity to my spirit, and the arrival of Agatha at the
prison still further reconciled me to my doom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thy
sacrifice is hallowed,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;thou wilt die, but
I must live to expiate my crime, as the slave of thy ghastly son,
till Heaven shall call him to itself.&nbsp; <i>He</i> stood by my
couch last night; smilingly he looked upon me, as in the days of
his early love, and bade me live and hope: in this world I shall
behold him no more! but thou, my beloved! thou art for the
distant land, and the abode whither he is gone before thee.&nbsp;
Oh that I might share thy doom, as I have already partaken thy
guilt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We parted&mdash;let me not dwell upon that&mdash;we
parted for ever; for me there remained a mighty duty to fulfil,
and from which I did not shrink&mdash;no, not even when those who
had been my friends sought to wring my secret from my heart by
the infliction of the torture: I pitied <i>them</i>, but not
myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day of torture came; thou wert by my side, and
didst urge a voluntary death to rescue me from agony and the
stare of burning eyes eagerly watching my pangs.&nbsp; I rejected
thy counsel; yet didst thou not forsake me, but marched to the
scene of my infamy by my side.&nbsp; All around, as I went
thither, did I look for the promised appearance of my brother,
and trembled lest I <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>should not behold him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Surely this is mine hour of agony,&rsquo; I said, as I
ascended the steps of the scaffold; &lsquo;wherefore is he not by
my side?&rsquo;&nbsp; And the guest from the other
world,&mdash;he beneath whose scowl my heart had for months been
withering,&mdash;was desired with more impatience than ever I had
felt for the presence of earthly friends.&nbsp; I had not long to
fear or to doubt&mdash;he was there before me; on reaching the
scaffold, I beheld him standing by the block, and calmly and
silently smiling a welcome to his brother.&nbsp; Thou didst
behold my firmness, and the multitude saw my composure with
wonder; but they beheld not the cause; they saw not that
<i>he</i> was looking on, and that I drew in resolution from his
smile, and firmness from his awful brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ineffectual agony was past&mdash;curiosity was
silenced&mdash;and I was condemned to die; and to-morrow I
<i>shall</i> die,&mdash;from all that I have loved hated, or
valued, I shall be torn to-morrow.&nbsp; The last sunset is
falling upon my paper, is gilding my pen as I write; to-morrow it
will sparkle upon the edge of the axe, and illuminate a brow from
which the inward light will have departed for ever; to-morrow
will be the scene of my last humiliation: but <i>he</i> will be
there to witness it, and convert it by his presence into a
triumph; and, when all shall be over, when the last mortal throb
shall be past, what then shall be my destiny?&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou
art pardoned,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and an immortality is before
thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, then let me hope for an immortality of
peace!&nbsp; Now, then, I will go sleep&mdash;exhausted nature
must be recruited for her great labour to-morrow&mdash;for these
broken limbs, these strained sinews, and this bruised flesh, must
needs want repose, ere they can encounter <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>the task of
fresh exertion.&nbsp; Serve me well, ye mangled limbs, but
to-morrow, and I shall require your service no
more.&mdash;Courtenay, good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the tale of the fratricide, and of him who was his
victim: of her who survived the deaths of both, no more was
heard; for upon Courtenay&rsquo;s going to the cottage at the
period she had appointed to receive her last commands, he learned
she had quitted it two days previous, but had left a small parcel
to be given to him: it contained a few remembrances of herself
and Eustace, and the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Courtenay</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In giving thee the papers containing our story, I have
obeyed the last wish of him whose lightest word was a law to me;
but I cannot look on thee again after this communication.&nbsp;
Grieve not for me, for my lot will not be wretched; the death of
my child has released me from the world, and I hasten to withdraw
myself from it: I had arranged all things for the purpose before
I sent to request thy presence.&nbsp; Endeavour not to discover
me; such search would be fruitless and vain.&nbsp; I retire from
the kingdom; and in a convent of Clairs, beneath the habits and
rules of the order, and under another name, conceal for ever,
from the eyes of the world, the person, the crime, and the sorrow

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span> about the year 112, in
winter or summer&mdash;we are not exactly prepared to say
which&mdash;died Olave the Second, one of the early kings of
Denmark; he was a &ldquo;fellow of no reckoning,&rdquo; for he
took no account of any thing that occurred during his reign,
except the making of strong drink, and the number of butts in his
cellar.&nbsp; His majesty, it must be avowed, was in the
presumptuous habit of forestalling the joys of heaven, (we mean
Odin&rsquo;s,) that is to say, he impiously got drunk every day
of his life, before the regular allowance of fighting, the
customary number of enemies&rsquo; broken heads, and his own
orderly death upon the field of battle, bore testimony that he
was properly qualified for such supreme enjoyment.&nbsp; Olave in
his life was a happy fellow; for, never having been sober during
one hour of it, he had not the misfortune to hear all the
ill-natured things that his courtiers and subjects said of his
enormities, behind his back, or when he was asleep.&nbsp; It
must, however, be acknowledged that, <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>even among the unscrupulous Danes,
who were not at that period remarkable for their practice of
sobriety, Olave was a filthy fellow: to this hour he is held up
as a monument of brutality and stupidity, and the memory of
Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, was not more
devoted to execration among the Jews, than that of king Olave the
Second among the Danes.&nbsp; On his death-bed, however, when he
could no longer swallow his usual enlivening potations, blue
devils beset his nights, and conscience twitted him with his
ill-spent days.&nbsp; He had never broken a head in his life,
except by proxy; and how could he make his appearance in Valhalla
without a skull to drink out of?&mdash;to knock at the gates of
Valasciolf without a goblet in his hand?&mdash;The thing was
impossible; it was clear he would be kicked through Asgard, and
sent to fret in Nifthiem, where the burning claws of Lok would
set fire to the good liquor incorporated with his being, and
reduce him to the condition of an eternal, thinking
cinder!&mdash;Miserable anticipations! he tried to weep; but
water, which he had hitherto scorned, now scorned him, and
absolutely refused to come at his desire: he shed tears of mead,
which he caught in his mouth as fast as they fell, partly from
fear lest Odin should remark them, and partly because he could
not endure to see good liquor wasted.</p>
<p>But all things have an end&mdash;in this world at
least&mdash;and so it was with the life and repentance of king
Olave the Second; he died without the drinking-cup he had
regretted so deeply, and before he had time to frame a decent
apology to Odin for venturing into Valhalla without one.&nbsp;
There was a world of business now to be done at the <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>palace of
Sandaal: a dead king to be buried, and two living kings to be
crowned; for such was the will of the lamented Olave, that both
his sons should succeed him.&nbsp; They were princes of very
different characters, yet their father, it should seem, loved
them equally, as he divided his dominions very fairly between
them, to the no small disgust of the elder prince, Frotho, who,
like the imperial Octavius, some years before, could not bear a
divided throne.&nbsp; This worthy in character resembled, in no
slight degree, his excellent father, of dozy memory, for he loved
to drink much and fight little,&mdash;more especially as his
younger brother Harold had a decided vocation for the latter
employment, and none at all for the former: to him, therefore, he
left the charge of the glory of the Danish crown, while he, for
the present, contented himself with drinking to his
successes.&nbsp; This good understanding, however, between the
princes could not last for ever.&nbsp; Frotho was, after all,
only half a drunkard, and therefore extremely sulky in his
cups&mdash;more especially when his queen Helga seated herself at
his elbow to twit his courage with the heroic deeds of his
brother.&nbsp; Queen consorts should not meddle with politics,
they never do anything but mischief&mdash;and so it proved in
this instance; for Frotho grew absolutely delirious, kept himself
entirely sober for three whole days, buckled on his wooden
target, put himself at the head of his troops, and, swearing to
be revenged upon his brother, marched on an expedition to
Jutland.&nbsp; The expedition neither answered his intentions nor
expectations; the men of Jutland were too many for king Frotho,
for, headed by Feggo, (the murderous uncle of the philosophic
Hamlet, <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>whose father was prince only of this part of Denmark,)
they drove Frotho &ldquo;home without boots, and in foul weather
too,&rdquo; as Glendwr did, long afterwards, king Harry
Bolingbroke.&nbsp; Frotho could not stomach this
affront&mdash;the beating was hard of digestion: his subjects
made mouths at him too, and mimicked a race whenever he appeared
in public.&nbsp; So he sent his brother, king Harold, who was a
fighter to the back-bone, to chastise the Jutlanders, which when
he had done most effectually, Frotho grew more angry still; he
detested his brother, dreaded his popularity, feared his wisdom,
and quivered at his anger,&mdash;so he began to consider
seriously how he might cleverly and quietly put him out of the
way.</p>
<p>King Frotho had two counsellors, neither of whom ever agreed
with the other in the advice they gave his majesty: the reason
was tolerably obvious, for the one was an honest man, the other a
rogue, and, like the Topaz and Ebene of Voltaire, they bewildered
the unhappy monarch with the diversity of their opinions and
advice.&nbsp; On this occasion, however, king Frotho troubled
only the rogue for his advice, which he was pretty certain
beforehand would not differ very widely from his own.&nbsp; Eric
Swen was an unprincipled ragamuffin, who hated Harold, because he
had discovered that Harold hated his vices; and, as that prince
had two sons who were rising into manhood, he shuddered at the
prospect of two or three strict warrior reigns, which would
certainly bring virtue into fashion: the prince had refused him,
too, the hand of his sister, which, to make the refusal more
bitter, he had bestowed upon his rival in the council and camp,
Frotho&rsquo;s general, Haquin.&nbsp; All these offences were
carefully summoned up, to <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>inflame his ire against Harold, by
the devil, in the shape of Frotho, who promised him&mdash;Heaven
knows what&mdash;both on earth and in Valhalla, if he would only
push king Harold from his share of the stool, and leave both
halves of it to Frotho.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all the provocations on both sides, the
confederates were two or three whole years before they could
&ldquo;screw their courage to the sticking place,&rdquo; that is,
to the pitch necessary for the murder of king Harold.&nbsp; They
had sent fifty inconsiderable nobles, whom they had found
troublesome, to Asgard, without ceremony; but Harold was a king
and a warrior, and required a good deal.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we could
but pour poison into his ear,&rdquo; said Eric; &ldquo;Or into
his cup,&rdquo; replied Frotho; &ldquo;Or stab him in his
sleep,&rdquo; said Eric; &ldquo;Or coax him out hunting with
us,&rdquo; replied the brother, &ldquo;and give it to him quietly
in the forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; But none of these safe plans would
answer;&mdash;so Frotho, accompanied by his sole and trusty
counsellor, rode off for the forest, to find the cave where,
tradition said, had resided, from the days of the
&ldquo;Avate&rdquo; of Odin, his enemy Biorno, the descendant of
Lok, grand nephew of Surter, and first cousin to the Wolf Fenris
and Serpent Midgard.&nbsp; Frotho, however well disposed to beg
the aid and advice of the sorcerer, by no means felt at ease when
he considered the family to which he belonged: the wolf and the
eternal earth-circling snake were known to bear no very great
partiality to the race of Odin,&mdash;and Frotho, they knew, if
they knew any thing, was a true son of their enemy.&nbsp; Still
the Danish monarch trotted on with his squire till they reached
the centre of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, Eric,&rdquo; said his majesty, as they <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>trotted on
cosily together; &ldquo;after all&rdquo;&mdash;but, as an
historian, I must make one observation here: you are aware, dear
reader, that the Scandinavians of the year 112, and some time
after, did not use the same simple, plain, common-place sort of
style which they have adopted to express their meaning
now-a-days.&nbsp; If we may believe their own writers, they were
always in alt, gave their commands in a kind of heroic prose, and
carried on dialogues in a sort of rambling blank verse.&nbsp; It
must therefore be obvious to you, dear reader, that I spare you
their language, and only give you their sentiments, which, to the
best of my humble ability I will translate for you into decent
colloquial English, the better to carry your patience through the
long-winded history which I am preparing as a trial for it.&nbsp;
But to return to Frotho the fifth of Denmark.&nbsp; &ldquo;After
all, Eric,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have perhaps no great reason
to fear these ugly immortals: as I am going to consult their
kinsman, and am withal very well disposed to put an end to the
race of Odin, (that part of it at least most devoted to him,) I
think they may be civil to me.&nbsp; My own son Sevald is the
only member of the family I wish to preserve, and I may soon
mould him to my own opinions.&nbsp; If the sorcerer will only
dispose of Harold for me, or tell me how I may safely dispose of
him, I shall not haggle on the terms of assistance; I will do any
thing to serve him or his, which may not interfere with my own
safety, or rob me of the diadem I am so anxious to wear
alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eric was about to reply to his magnanimous
master, but paused, half afraid, as he discovered they were
really in the sorcerer&rsquo;s neighbourhood, for the yawning
mouth of the cave was actually staring them in <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>the
face.&nbsp; Frotho, as became him, now took the lead, and marched
dauntlessly forward, though not without a glance backward now and
then to see if Eric was close behind him, and as any sound struck
upon his ear that bore any resemblance to a hiss or a howl.&nbsp;
At length, after many turnings and windings, he found himself in
a cavern of large dimensions, broadly lighted by a huge iron
lamp, suspended from the upper part of it.&nbsp; He turned round
to make some remark to his patient tail-piece, but was petrified
to observe that he had fallen to the earth stiff and insensible
to every thing around him.&nbsp; The Danish monarch&rsquo;s
cheeks waxed pale, and his knees began to smite each other;
nevertheless he grasped the hilt of his falchion, as a slight
noise on the opposite side withdrew his attention from the
insensible Eric Swen; there stood an old man of reverend aspect,
mildly but steadily gazing upon the king: &ldquo;Art thou he whom
I have been so long taught to expect?&rdquo; said the sorcerer;
&ldquo;art thou the king of the race of Odin, alone chosen by his
invincible foe to render a service to the son of Lok, and deserve
the everlasting gratitude of his children?&nbsp; If indeed thou
art the appointed, I bid thee highest welcome, for the task
decreed to thee hath been denied to the immortals, above whom the
grateful Lok will raise thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frotho recovered his spirits at this address; half his
business was already done, for his wishes were anticipated.&nbsp;
He had been so little accustomed to receive compliments from his
subjects, that his opinion of his own endowments had not been
particularly high; but now he began to think he had mistaken
himself, and was really a much greater man than he had
suspected.&nbsp; He readily <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>promised obedience to the sorcerer,
upon certain terms, and assured him of his assistance when and
wherever it might be demanded.&nbsp; The magician then proceeded
to inform him that he was himself a descendant of Lok, and an
ally of the spirits of fire, those daring beings who had for so
many thousand years waged war with various success against Odin
and his warriors, and which warfare would not cease till the end
of the world; when, during a night which was to last a year,
there would be a general battle, in which Earth, Niftheim, and
Asgard, would go to wreck, and the conquering party be elevated
to a newer and more beautiful heaven in Gimle,&mdash;while
Nastrande, a still gloomier hell, would be made out of the
fragments of the old one, for the accommodation of the party
conquered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Balder!&rdquo; exclaimed Frotho, starting
at this part of the story,&mdash;for he never liked to hear any
thing of the old hell, which he thought quite bad enough without
the spirits troubling themselves about the creation of another;
&ldquo;but I thought, sir sorcerer, that the wicked alone would
be punished in Nastrande after the long night and battle of the
gods; I thought&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Exactly so, my son,&rdquo;
interrupted the sorcerer; &ldquo;the wicked certainly; for the
conquered <i>will</i> be the wicked&mdash;that is beyond dispute;
but <i>who</i> will conquer is not so certain; perhaps Lok,
perhaps Odin&mdash;each, as far as I see, have an equal chance;
take part then with us, and share our danger and glories in the
next world, and our certain assistance in this.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
this world, then, (as king Frotho had at present more business in
it,) he limited his wishes, and gave Biorno his steady attention
as he proceeded in his narrative, &ldquo;Odin,&rdquo; the
magician continued to <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>observe, &ldquo;though utterly
unable to chain entirely the powers of Lok, had just now
decidedly the advantage; for he had a few hundred years before
seized upon his eldest son, the unwary Surter, whom he had caught
out of his own territories, and wedged him, in the shape of a
raven, into an iron cage, there to remain till one of his own
race, a kingly son of his blood, should release
him:&rdquo;&mdash;a condition from Odin probably implying an
eternal punishment,&mdash;as that divinity, who does not appear
to have been as omniscient as he ought, never imagined any member
of his house would have been found silly enough to fulfil
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; continued the magician,
&ldquo;I have consulted the eternal powers, and find that thou,
Frotho of Denmark, art the king destined to this wondrous deed,
and its following union with the immortals.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frotho
gave his assent to all and any thing proposed; and the sorcerer
immediately began his operations; he raised his ebon wand above
his head, with many magical flourishes&mdash;turned himself
rapidly round&mdash;then more slowly, pausing at each of the
cardinal points, and calling north, south, east, and west, upon
the tremendous name of Lok.&nbsp; At that sound, so terrible even
to the ears of spirits, the thunder began to rumble and the fires
of Niftheim flash through the gloomy cavern; something like music
was heard, and, though the concert was hardly better than those
performed by king Frotho&rsquo;s own band during his drinking
orgies, yet as the voices (and they were many) solely employed
their powers in singing his praises, and the approaching
deliverance of the god by his means, his majesty was pleased to
think nothing in heaven could be half so fine.&nbsp; Presently
the earth shook, and the sides of the <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>cavern rocked; Biorno pointed to the
bottom of the cave,&mdash;and Frotho beheld it, after a few
violent convulsions, suddenly open, and disclose to his view an
enormous raven, in a gigantic iron cage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said the magician to him, &ldquo;the prison
of the immortal prince of fire!&mdash;in that shape he must
remain a hundred thousand years, unless a kingly hand of the line
of Odin shall restore him (by breaking the bars of his iron cage)
to power and to liberty.&nbsp; Monarch of Denmark! go,&mdash;and
success attend thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frotho obeyed immediately; he
made a desperate attack upon the iron cage, but failed in his
intention of rending away its bars; he made many earnest efforts,
but all in vain,&mdash;the bars remained unbroken.&nbsp; The Dane
paused in vexation&mdash;he was frightened and
mortified&mdash;and, by the howls and groans which resounded on
all sides of the cavern, it was evident the anxious spirits of
Niftheim sympathised in his distress: Biorno too, afflicted
beyond measure at the ill success of the enterprise, threw
himself upon the earth, tore off his magical cap, plucked up his
hair by the roots, and howled as loudly as the noisiest of
them.&nbsp; This dismal sight drove Frotho desperate; he
collected all his energies for one mighty pull, rushed upon the
cage, grappled with the bars, and, in an instant, threw them at
the sorcerer&rsquo;s feet, who sprung up like an elk to receive
them.&nbsp; Frotho stood majestically silent, while an uproar,
such as no human ear has ever heard since, began its diversions
in the cavern; a thick black mist quickly filled its whole space,
so that Frotho could but indistinctly distinguish the figures who
made up the ball; millions of shadows were flitting about, and
millions of voices were laughing, singing, shouting, groaning,
and <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>cursing.&nbsp; Midgard raised his glittering snaky head
above the darkness and the shadows, and greeted the monarch with
a cordial and complimentary hiss; wolf Fenris tried hard for a
good-natured howl; and the grim Hela, their sister, the queen of
death, tortured her ghastly face into a smile, as she capered
nimbly backwards and forwards in the festival, animated by the
thought of the many meals Frotho would furnish for her famished
maw.&nbsp; But, at length, the immortals grew weary of their own
noises&mdash;the infernal jollification came to an end&mdash;the
mist cleared off&mdash;the fires went out&mdash;the uproar died
away,&mdash;and Frotho&rsquo;s courage returned to its
half-bewildered master, who took heart once again to look about
him.&nbsp; He was alone (to his great joy) with Biorno, except
that, in place of the raven and his cage, there sat, reposing
upon a light cloud, his beautiful brow diademed with his native
element, the triumphant prince of fire, in all the pride of
beauty and victory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Frotho, son of Olave,&rdquo;
said the sweet voice of the spirit; &ldquo;bravest among the
brave, and wisest of the sons of Odin,&mdash;what is thy will
with me?&nbsp; Tax my gratitude, preserver; ask, and obtain thy
wishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frotho waited for no further encouragement,
but directly stated his wishes to reign alone in Denmark, and
sweep off all the collaterals of his house, who were such bars to
his glory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy brother&rsquo;s life I give
thee,&rdquo; said the spirit; &ldquo;destroy him when thou wilt,
but be cautious to keep it secret: his elder son shall in vain
endeavour to oppose thee&mdash;I will baffle his claim, and
proclaim thee sole monarch in Denmark; but touch not the life of
Haldane; he has offended Lok, and the god demands the victim,
whom he will receive from no mortal <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>hand: for Harold the younger, do
with him as thou wilt, but, if thou spare his life, he shall have
no power to harm thee;
go&mdash;reign&mdash;prosper;&mdash;nothing shall do thee wrong
till thyself shall fulfil a decree which is gone forth respecting
thee; thou shall prosper till thy hand shall unite thy own blood
to that of thy deadliest foe: beware of this, and
triumph.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Prince of the powers of
Niftheim,&rdquo; said Frotho, &ldquo;surely Harold, my brother,
is my deadliest foe, and he has no daughter to whom I can give my
son; but I will be mindful of thy words, and remember thy
warning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The spirit then desired him, should any
event disturb his tranquillity, to come to the cavern and strike
thrice upon the side where stood the iron cage: &ldquo;Biorno
shall meet thee,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;and yield thee, in
my name, such help as thou mayest require;&rdquo; then, slowly
and silently encircling himself in the clouds which surrounded
him, he gradually disappeared from the sight of Frotho, leaving
the cavern illuminated only by the light of the iron lamp which
hung from its centre.&nbsp; Biorno, too, had vanished, leaving
him alone with Eric Swen, who, now easily awakened from his
trance, prepared to follow his master home, who simply informed
his confidant that he had consulted the magician, who had advised
the murder of Harold, and promised him success in its
performance.&nbsp; This was readily undertaken by the profligate
Eric, who, watching, with a lynx-like assiduity, his opportunity,
plunged his sword in the heart of the unhappy Harold with such
right good will and judgment, that the prince died before he knew
he was wounded: nor was Frotho behind his confederate in the good
management of a difficult affair, and skill in getting out of a
<a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>dilemma;
and this was especially proved, when the body of Eric Swen,
transfixed by a well-aimed javelin, was found stark and stiff by
the side of king Harold, and Frotho ordered every body to believe
that these enemies had fallen in single combat with each
other.</p>
<p>There was one Dane in the court of king Frotho who took the
liberty of believing contrarily to the royal orders; this was the
brave Haquin, the brother-in-law of the two kings, and their
favourite general and minister; he knew Frotho, and he suspected
foul play.&nbsp; He secured the persons of his murdered
master&rsquo;s two sons, and, giving out that Haldane should
challenge his father&rsquo;s crown against Frotho, in an assembly
of the states, retired from the court to his own towers, till the
nobles should be pleased to appoint a day for hearing the claim
of his ward.&nbsp; In the mean time, Haldane himself had not been
idle; he employed a good number of his vacant hours in making
tender love to his beautiful cousin, the young Ildegarda, and
laying at her feet the crown which he <i>was</i> to have, and
which Ildegarda accepted, as a thing of course; for she already
considered herself the queen of Denmark.&nbsp; Haldane was
tenderly beloved, and they each looked forward to the day on
which he was to claim his father&rsquo;s crown from the ambitious
Frotho, as that which was to seal their love and their
happiness.</p>
<p>That day at length arrived; the states, the nobles, the
warriors, and a great part of the troops, were assembled in an
open plain, where Frotho, on his throne, awaited the arrival of
his kinsman.&nbsp; His majesty had arrayed himself with peculiar
splendour for this solemn occasion; his long hair, now slightly
tinged with grey, floated down his <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>back, while all his face was clean
shaven, except his upper lip, which exhibited a most magnanimous
moustache; his breast, arms, and legs were painted in the
brightest blue, and the most fashionable pattern in Denmark; a
short petticoat of lynx skin, fastened round his waist by the
paws of the animal, descended to his knees; and from his
shoulders to his heels, secured round his neck by claws of gold,
fell the robe of royal magnificence, the mantle made of the skins
of many ermines; his feet were defended by shoes of the sable of
the black fox; his neck was ornamented by a chain of gold, and
the regal circle of the same precious metal shone through his
locks around his temples; on his left arm was a target of
leather, studded with brass nails of unusual brightness and
immense value; in his right hand he held the sceptre; he sat upon
a throne covered with the hides of wolves, and over his head
floated, in proud sublimity, the standard of Denmark, the
raven.</p>
<p>People may talk as long as they please about innate dignity
and the majesty of mind, but the majesty of fine clothes has a
much greater influence upon popular opinion,&mdash;else wherefore
that elderly proverb which sayeth that &ldquo;fine feathers make
fine birds?&rdquo;&nbsp; Every body knows that king Herod&rsquo;s
silver petticoat made the stupid mob of Judea mistake him for a
god; and on this day, so important to Haldane, Frotho&rsquo;s
amazing magnificence made <i>his</i> people mistake him for a
hero.&nbsp; So strong ran the tide of popular opinion, that when
Haldane, simply habited, mounted on his snow-white steed, and
only attended by Haquin and a few of his father&rsquo;s friends,
rode up the area, they scarcely deigned (though he was rich in
all <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>the
pride of youth and graceful beauty) to consider him worth looking
at; all eyes were turned to Frotho&rsquo;s painted waistcoat and
superb ermine cloak; and Haldane also beheld, with extreme
disgust, that all his own friends, and the warriors favourable to
his claims, who had fought by his side under his father&rsquo;s
banner, had been carefully excluded from the council, which he
beheld supplied by the creatures of his uncle; he saw that his
cause was lost before he could say a word: he was not daunted
nevertheless; he demanded his right from Frotho, who, refusing to
admit his claim, was challenged by the youth to decide the
quarrel on the spot.&nbsp; &ldquo;The states and the troops are
present,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;let them be witnesses of
this combat, which thy ungenerous ambition must render mortal: if
thou desirest a double crown, shew that thou knowest how to
defend it; descend from thy throne, meet me fairly, and let
Denmark be the reward of the conqueror.&rdquo;&nbsp; Slowly, very
slowly, king Frotho rose from his throne, for he saw that
something was expected of him: although not precisely a coward,
he had no mind to encounter his nephew, whose feats of arms he
well knew: and earnestly and anxiously he put up a prayer to
Surter to remember his promise, and baffle his kinsman in this
trying emergency.&nbsp; Surter was not deaf; for scarcely had the
monarch put forth one leg for the purpose of descending from his
throne, ere a wonder attracted the attention of the whole
assembly; the sound of rushing wings was heard from a distance,
and slowly, sailing steadily through the clear air towards his
point, appeared a gigantic raven: black as the shining locks of
Odin was the magnificent and stately bird, who, tranquilly
passing <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>over the multitude, suspended himself in air over the
head of Frotho, and, hovering steadily above him, clapped his
enormous pinions in triumph.&nbsp; Haldane suspected a
trick&mdash;Haquin was startled&mdash;but the multitude beheld a
miracle, and the will of Odin clearly expressed by his own
particular messenger: the bird hovered in the air a few moments,
to witness the general acknowledgment of Frotho, then, amidst the
deafening shouts of the people, ascended slowly upwards, cleaved
through the clouds, and vanished.</p>
<p>Haldane stood apart, during the scene, in proud contempt of
the ingratitude of his people; and the multitude were making too
terrific an uproar to allow his few friends one word in his
favour.&nbsp; Frotho, pleased by the timely aid of Surter, was
grateful for the first time in his life; and, remembering the
commands of the spirit, abstained from taking what he yet
scarcely knew how to spare, the hated life of Haldane.&nbsp;
Assuming an air of paternal interest and kindness, he bade the
young prince retire from his presence and kingdom, without fear
of molestation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Son of my brother,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;seek another kingdom for thy rule, this the gods have
given to Frotho; retire peaceably, and take with thee what part
of my treasure thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The crown,
then,&rdquo; boldly replied the prince; &ldquo;for what is there,
traitor! in thy power to bestow, that is not already mine by
right?&nbsp; No! mean-souled coward!&nbsp; I scorn thy courtesy,
and I defy thy anger.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this gallant resistance
availed nothing in a lost cause; his own party counselled him,
for the present, to get out of the reach of Frotho&rsquo;s
javelin; and, too wise to disdain advice alike given by friends
and enemies, he obeyed their wishes, and, after taking <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>a tender
leave of his betrothed Ildegarda, and promising to claim her as a
king, withdrew to Sweden to solicit aid from its warlike monarch
in defence of his title,&mdash;aid which he did not receive; for
king Frotho soon after received notice that he had been murdered
on that inhospitable coast soon after his landing, and, as it
could never be ascertained by whom, Frotho silently congratulated
himself upon the sure and ready vengeance of his ally and
divinity, Surter.&nbsp; Haquin, alarmed by this circumstance, and
more than ever suspecting the honesty of king Frotho, withdrew
from court with the young Harold, now the sole surviving son of
his murdered master, and, proclaiming him lawful king of Denmark,
set up his standard in the heart of the country.&nbsp; Many
powerful nobles, disgusted by the cruel brutality of his uncle,
immediately joined him; and Frotho, frightened by danger into
valour, and relying upon the promises of Surter, put himself at
the head of his troops, and prepared for a civil war.</p>
<p>Many skirmishes took place between the hostile powers, though
nothing very decisive occurred; but the troops of Frotho had
generally the advantage, and always when the king commanded in
person.&nbsp; Joy of this discovery nearly upset his majesty; he
began to think himself a great general as well as a gallant
warrior: he got exceedingly drunk with some of his old cronies
who had made the discovery, and, during the deep sleep which
followed this little extravagance, Haquin attacked his camp, beat
his generals, carried off his son Sevald a prisoner, and nearly
seized upon his sacred majesty himself, who knew nothing at all
of the matter.&nbsp; Poor Sevald was marched off for the camp of
the enemy, in a transport of sorrow and despair.</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;Be not offended, prince,&rdquo; said the good
Haquin to him when he was brought before him in his
tent,&mdash;&ldquo;be not offended that the chance of war has
placed thy person in my custody for a season; it is no dishonour
to be the prisoner of Haquin.&nbsp; Our war is with thy father,
not with thee; and should Harold succeed, even to the slaying of
his uncle, he will never wrong thee, but yield thee thy just
right, a second throne in Denmark: be not disturbed therefore at
the slight accident of this war.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was kindly
meant, but it entirely failed in its purpose, and Sevald would
have still continued to grieve if he had not discovered that fair
princesses are better comforters than old soldiers.&nbsp; He
learned that his lovely cousin Ildegarda was in the camp of her
father, and he concluded that things were not quite so bad as
they might have been.&nbsp; Sevald admired his fair kinswoman
extremely, and, as Haldane&rsquo;s death had set her free, he
worked out the prettiest little romantic scheme possible for
putting an end to the horrors of civil war and restoring peace to
Denmark: he determined to entreat his father to give him
Ildegarda for his bride, to adopt Harold as his partner, and thus
to reconcile all parties to his ascendancy; but, unhappily for
poor Sevald&rsquo;s delightful scheme, all the persons concerned
in it were, though for different reasons, materially against
it.&nbsp; Ildegarda, true to the memory of Haldane, would listen
to no second love,&mdash;Haquin, faithful to the cause he had
adopted, would rather have consigned his daughter to the grave
than to the arms of a son of Frotho,&mdash;and the Danish monarch
would entirely have lost the little wit he possessed, at the bare
possibility of such a destructive union as that of his own blood
with <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>that of his deadliest foe, for such now had the father
of Ildegarda become to him.&nbsp; When he did hear it, he grew
absolutely wild with terror and rage; he imprecated the most
deadly curses upon his son, should he venture to espouse his
cousin; and flew off like a madman to the cave of Biorno in the
forest, to consult him in this most desperate emergency.&nbsp; He
found the sorcerer at home, and willing to assist him, which he
civilly did by the best advice in his power; he desired him to
return to his camp and attack the troops of Haquin, promising to
commit that leader, his daughter, and prince Sevald, safely into
his custody; at the same time hinting that, as Surter had done as
much for his friend as could decently be expected, he need not
call upon him for further assistance, which, unless from his own
imprudence, he would not need, and Lok had prohibited them from
supplying.&nbsp; Frotho thanked him for past favours and present
services, and, promising to demand nothing more for the future,
they parted good friends, though not to meet again in this world
at least, whatever might happen in the other.&nbsp; Frotho had no
sooner reached his camp, than he hastened to profit by his
friend&rsquo;s advice, and instantly experienced its salutary
effects; he defeated his antagonists in a pitched battle,
recovered his son Sevald, and, to his infinite joy, possessed
himself of the persons of Haquin and his daughter, though Harold
escaped in the battle, and hid himself securely from the pursuit
of his enemy.&nbsp; Had Frotho followed the suggestions of his
own cruel heart, he would have decided Haquin&rsquo;s destiny at
once by taking off his head; but, fearful of his nobles, who held
the chief in high esteem, and having likewise no hope of
discovering <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Harold, except through his friend, he resolved to spare
his existence, but to keep him in close imprisonment with his
daughter, whose influence over Sevald he still dreaded, and whom,
as the daughter of his sister, he dared not injure farther.&nbsp;
The poor prince wept bitterly over his ruined hopes, and Frotho
rejoiced at the delightful consummation of his: he enjoyed
himself in his own way, killing and drinking by
turns,&mdash;till, in a fit of madness and extravagance, he
impiously declared that he had a Valhalla of his own, which he
would not change for Odin&rsquo;s, upon any terms that divinity
could offer.&nbsp; Every thing was happiness in the palace, and
Frotho was the most mischievous and merry of kings.</p>
<h3>PART II.<br />
THE ISLE OF THE MAELSTROM.</h3>
<blockquote><p>What have we here? a Man or a Fish?&mdash;Legged
like a Man, and his fins like arms.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Every</span> sweet hath its
sour,&rdquo; saith a very respectable old ballad,&mdash;and truly
there is wisdom in the saying.&nbsp; King Frotho&rsquo;s
sanctity, as a crowned prince of the holy race of Odin, became at
this period, for the first time, somewhat of an inconvenience to
him.&nbsp; In the midst of his festivities, howls and cries
penetrated to his palace, and reached his ears, though surrounded
by buzzing flatterers, and rendered dizzy by strong
potations.&nbsp; His people of Norway were unhappy, and they
called upon their common father to relieve their <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>misery.&nbsp; A pest had arisen among them which no one
could conquer, for no one knew how to attack: the frightful
whirlpool of the Maelstrom had a guest, and the desolate island
of Moskoe an inhabitant; it was neither man, beast, bird, nor
fish, that had taken up his residence in this part of his Danish
majesty&rsquo;s dominions, but a most extraordinary compound
monster, possessing all the faculties of each of these several
creations.&nbsp; As he had his little island entirely to himself,
the want of society suggested to him an expedient by way of
amusement, and also of remedying this evil&mdash;he employed his
leisure in making descents upon the Norwegian coast, and carrying
off the grown inhabitants, four or five at a time, and the little
children by dozens, whom he devoured with as little remorse as he
would young rabbits or dried herrings.&nbsp; The people were
terrified, and the nobles began to bestir themselves; they sent
out armed men in well-built boats, headed by an able leader, and
desired them to bring in the monster prisoner; but the lord of
the Maelstrom, so far from being brought to consent to this
arrangement, exactly reversed the orders of the Norwegian
ministry, for he sunk all their boats, and carried their crews
prisoners to his island.&nbsp; Frotho heard this pitiful tale
with much indifference, till they besought him to go in person
against their enemy, well knowing that no magic or infernal power
could succeed against the race of Odin;&mdash;then he sprung up
in alarm, and declining, in his own person, all pretensions to
superior sanctity, sent one of his best generals with a band of
his own chosen troops, in two gallant vessels, to seize or
destroy the monster.&nbsp; All Norway assembled on the coast to
witness their successes; they saw <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>the ships sail gallantly on, and, on
the opposite coast, the giant monster rush into the waves to meet
them.&nbsp; With a strength against which they could not contend,
he seized the luckless vessels, drew them coolly and steadily on
to the frightful gulf of the Maelstrom, and then, swimming back
to his island, left the noble ships to be sucked into the
frightful bosom of the gulf.&mdash;The waves swept over them, and
the tale of their deeds was told.</p>
<p>Frotho was frightened into sobriety when this news reached
him; Denmark became as clamorous as Norway in the matter, and he
was compelled to promise that he would exert his sanctity, and go
in person to the attack of the monster: but he delayed as long as
he possibly could, and, under pretence of making preparations,
gave the fiend of the Maelstrom time to eat half the children in
Norway.&nbsp; At length &ldquo;delays became dangerous&rdquo;
even to Frotho himself; he was obliged to depart, and, well
armed, well guarded, and well attended by a resolute band of the
bravest of his nobles and chiefs, set sail, on a fine sunny day,
for the desolate isle of the Maelstrom.&nbsp; His magnanimous
majesty could not, however, help shivering at the first glance of
the island; but he took courage, on remarking that the beast did
not come out to meet him, nor advance to the attack as in the
former instance; so he landed in good spirits on the island,
promising himself immortal glory in his conquest.&nbsp; A
sufficient band was left in charge of the vessels, and Frotho,
with his chiefs, went boldly forward into the island.</p>
<p>In the first few miles there was nothing to astonish them;
rugged rocks, a roaring sea, and desolate naked heaths, were all
that greeted the travellers: they had expected nothing else, for
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>the
Moskoe was well known to most of the party, and had never been
suspected of sheltering a paradise in its bosom.&nbsp; Such,
however, to their boundless astonishment, the heroes now found to
be the case.&nbsp; A beautiful country arose amidst the desolate
isle; and, after the first five miles, hills, dales, fertile
valleys, richly wooded groves, and sparkling rivers, said a
thousand smiling good-morrows to the travellers.&nbsp; The scene
was too charming to terrify, else the total absence of anything
like human inhabitants might have been sufficient to startle king
Frotho, and make him doubt whether all was as it should be in
this particular part of his dominion.&nbsp; There was a total
silence around them, unbroken, save by the sweet warblings of
birds, or now and then the light foot of the flying deer, as,
scared by the clatter of their arms, they fled from them into the
forests.&nbsp; Thus they proceeded till they arrived before the
gates of a majestic palace of black marble, whose open portals
courteously invited them to enter.&nbsp; Frotho paused&mdash;so
did his nobles; it was finer than any thing in Denmark;
infinitely larger, grander, bolder, blacker, than the palace of
Sandaal, the royal residence of king Frotho himself,&mdash;so
that it was clear no human hands had reared it: but whose hands
had?&mdash;a puzzling question, which king Frotho would not take
upon himself to answer.</p>
<p>But the portals stood invitingly wide open, and king Frotho
was waxing weary; so, without any further debate or permission
demanded, they marched into a stately hall, where invisible cooks
had made successful preparation for a magnificent supper; Frotho
looked and longed.&nbsp; There was venison, noble venison of the
flesh of the elk, <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>roasted wild boar, and a cistern of excellent fish
delicately stewed in whale fat; there was a bowl of hydromel, in
which king Frotho might have been drowned, and another of milk,
that might have served him for a bath:&mdash;in short, the
temptation was too great for the tempted; and though king Frotho
well knew the danger incurred, even by a son of Odin, in tasting
enchanted food, yet he could not resist the whale fat and the
hydromel.&nbsp; &ldquo;The monster certainly expected me,&rdquo;
said he to his attendants.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is willing to make his
peace with you,&rdquo; said they to the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
would be uncivil not to taste his good cheer,&rdquo; said the
master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us shew that we accept his
submission,&rdquo; replied the servants.&nbsp; So they all sat
down with one accord to the feast, and ate, and drank, and were
merry.</p>
<p>The bowl of hydromel was empty&mdash;Frotho was looking into
it disconsolately with one eye (for the other was asleep), and
growing angry with his nobles, who had assisted him too heartily,
and been over-zealous in obeying his commands to pledge him to
the health of their entertainer.&nbsp; After grumbling and
growling for some time over the huge and now dismal-looking bowl,
his majesty took it into his head to be displeased with the
inattention of his host, who had failed to remark and replenish,
as he ought to have done, the empty bowl of departed
hydromel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord beast of the island,&rdquo; said his
majesty, at length, having thought till his thirst grew
intolerable; &ldquo;lord beast of the island, I will permit thee
to be viceroy in Moskoe, but thou must not spare thy hydromel
when thy master deigns to visit thee.&nbsp; For thy good cheer, I
thank thee; thy meat is of the best, and abundant, but, by the
burning wheel on Balder&rsquo;s breast, <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>thy drink
was scanty; and I command thee hither to supply me with
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; A rumbling of thunder and a long terrific howl
was the answer to the speech of the monarch.&nbsp; Frotho
shivered with affright, for he thought he recognised, amid the
uproar, the voices of his old acquaintances the illustrious snake
and wolf, cousins of his sorcerer friend Biorno; and, as he was a
little diffident of their conduct, notwithstanding his services
to Surter, he did not altogether relish the meeting, under
present circumstances; so, ensconcing himself in the centre of
his gallant little band of valiant warriors, he patiently awaited
what was to be the second part of his entertainment.&nbsp; This
was settled in an instant; neither Fenris nor Midgard broke upon
the supper party of the monarch, but a being more horrible than
either, and infinitely more hideous than his or any imagination
had already conceived of the monster of the Maelstrom gulf.&nbsp;
A stern gigantic shape entered the hall, and stood steadily face
to face with king Frotho and his nobles: his features were
frightfully flat, and two sunken fiery eyes shot terrific glances
from a visage almost entirely covered with dark and grisly hair;
long black elf locks hung down upon his shoulders, huge teeth
grinned through his grisly beard, and his fingers and feet were
furnished with claws which were worthy of Nebuchadnezzar himself;
his enormous body was covered with black bear-skins, so disposed
as to serve him for a whole suit; and his huge hand grasped a
monstrous club, which seemed very desirous of a nearer
acquaintance with his majesty of Denmark&rsquo;s brains.&nbsp;
The monster contemplated the group for a moment in silence; he
suffered them even to draw their swords and advance exactly <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>one step
towards him, when he suddenly lifted his terrible club, and,
without striking a single blow, laid them all prostrate at his
feet.&nbsp; He then approached king Frotho; the son of Olave
shrunk from the uplifted club, and bellowed out, in terror and
haste, that he was the king of Denmark.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thy
errand?&rdquo; said the monster.&nbsp; King Frotho was
silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; observed the spectre;
&ldquo;and for its presumption, but for one thing which I expect
of thee, would bind thy trembling feet for ever to the spot where
thou standest staring at me.&nbsp; Hark thee! thou fool of
Surter&rsquo;s making! who hopest to overcome the invincible by
human arms,&mdash;hear, and obey what I shall command thee.&nbsp;
I do not hate thee, and would not harm thee, for thou art the
friend of Lok; but my wrath against the kingdoms must be
appeased, and my divinity acknowledged.&nbsp; I demand thy
daughter.&nbsp; A spotless virgin of royal blood must come
voluntarily hither to be sacrificed on this island, and thou must
conduct her: do this, and henceforth I too am thy friend; neglect
it, and my thunders shall shake thy palace of Sandaal, and this
club dash out thy brains and scatter them over thy sovereign
throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Frotho looked aghast&mdash;not at the condition of his
safety, but his utter inability to fulfil it&mdash;there was no
cheating such an enemy as this&mdash;so he told him the plain
truth, that he had no daughter, and humbly apologised for the
want of one.&nbsp; The monster yelled at him, and again lifted up
his club.&nbsp; Frotho, in agony, besought him to have pity, and
then suddenly recollected that he had a niece who was his
prisoner, and whom he very readily offered to his disposal.&nbsp;
The monster hesitated;&mdash;at length, in reply to
Frotho&rsquo;s earnest <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>entreaties, he consented to spare
his life, upon condition that, in the space of twenty days, he
should land the princess on the island, and deliver her safely
into his hands, to be sacrificed by his own high priest in his
palace; and promising, should Frotho fail in his engagement, on
the very next day, to shake Sandaal about his ears, and dish up
his carcass as a meal for Midgard.&nbsp; Frotho sealed his
promise with a solemn oath, and the monster dismissed him with a
kick on the throne-honouring part of his person, which sent him
not only through the palace gates, but one mile forward in his
journey to the coast, which long before he had gained, his
panting train overtook him, being driven out by the lord beast,
to wait upon and console their disgraced and afflicted
master.</p>
<p>King Frotho had no intention, rogue as he was, to cozen the
Moskoe monster; on the contrary, he was desirous to obtain his
friendship and forbearance towards his subjects and the little
Norwegian children for whom he had evinced such cannibal
prepossessions.&nbsp; He was not sorry, either, so effectually to
dispose of Ildegarda, whose union with his son he had such good
reason to fear.&nbsp; The difficulty would be to persuade the
princess to go voluntarily to be eaten.&nbsp; He was ingenious
however&mdash;naturally fertile in expedients&mdash;and he soon
hit upon a method of persuasion which he deemed infallible: he
told the poor princess that the monster demanded her or her
father as prisoners; that he allowed her to choose, and if she
thought proper to decline, he should ship off old Haquin
immediately, to be stewed in whale fat, and served up for supper
with milk sauce, according to the pleasure of the monster, in the
marble palace of <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>Moskoe: for his own part, in relation to herself, he
pretended he did not clearly understand to what the lord of the
island had destined her, but he hoped nothing so terrible as a
roast or a hash.&nbsp; Ildegarda wept, but came into the scheme
quicker than Frotho had anticipated.&nbsp; Haldane was dead, and
her father&rsquo;s life in danger; by the sacrifice of her own,
which was now really become indifferent to her, she could at
least preserve the last of these beloved beings, and therefore
she did not hesitate.&nbsp; Making Frotho swear a tremendous oath
(which she knew no Dane dared break), to release her father on
his return from Moskoe, she prepared to accompany the king, and,
in less than twenty days, Frotho and his beautiful victim landed
on the island, and prepared to march to the black palace
alone.</p>
<p>They had not proceeded far on their journey, when their
progress was arrested by the appearance of a singular cavalcade
coming to meet them; this consisted of a magnificently painted
chariot, drawn by four snow-white rein-deer, each of whom, to the
astonishment of Ildegarda, had feet of pure gold: behind it came
the monster-man himself, mounted upon a coal-black steed of
extraordinary size and beauty, who pawed the earth impatiently,
and, snorting and foaming as he reared, threw his magnificent
mane from side to side, as if weary of the slight restraint which
his rider appeared to impose upon him;&mdash;the latter had now a
bear-skin cap upon his head, on the top of which sat a monstrous
raven, decorating it by way of crest; and another on his wrist,
with infinite grace and gravity, seemed ready to serve him in
quality of falcon extraordinary.&nbsp; The cavalcade paused on
remarking <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>the strangers; and the grim monster, advancing to
Frotho, sternly demanded, &ldquo;Comes the maid
willingly?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She does,&rdquo; replied Frotho;
&ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;But the monster no longer gave him any
attention: he did not even look at Ildegarda, but, bending his
head down, towards his horse&rsquo;s ears, gravely and mildly
asked, &ldquo;Steed of heaven, art thou weary?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the horse; &ldquo;but I have to-day
been so long upon the earth, that its gross air is beginning to
affect me&mdash;the sod is heavy to my feet, and somewhat checks
my swiftness: let me relieve my legs, I pray thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The strange monster nodded his grisly head in reply, and Frotho
beheld the courser slowly and deliberately draw up his four black
legs, and let down three white ones in their places.&nbsp; The
king began now to guess his company; &ldquo;It is the wondrous
steed of Odin,&rdquo; said he in a whisper to Ildegarda;
&ldquo;the immortal eight-legged Sleipner: but what is he who
rides him?&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess had no time to answer this
question, even had she been able, for the monster seemed
determined to have all the conversation to himself.&nbsp; He
spoke to the raven on his head: &ldquo;Hugo,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;take the reins, guide my rein-deer smoothly, and conduct
the lady to the palace: and you, Mumin,&rdquo; added he to the
bird on his wrist, &ldquo;hasten homewards, and see that all be
prepared for the victim.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these terrible words,
the tears of Ildegarda began to flow, and Frotho prepared himself
to make a speech.&nbsp; The monster heeded neither the one nor
the other, but nodded to Ildegarda to ascend the chariot, which
when she had done, he turned round to Frotho, lifted up his
terrible club, and exclaimed, in a voice of thunder,
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was but one <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>word, but
the tone and the action weighed more than five hundred with
Frotho, who, fearing to hear it repeated, darted from the party,
and set sail for Denmark without once looking behind him.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Ildegarda was conducted by her ill-looking
escort to the marble palace, and left by him in the same hall in
which Frotho had rested on his first arrival: here, too, she
found a supper prepared for her, though in a somewhat different
taste from the former; but the princess had no inclination to
eat&mdash;indeed she felt determined not to be fattened before
killing, and threw herself upon the earth in a paroxysm of grief
and despair.&nbsp; Suddenly, soft and sweet music broke upon her
ear, and the beautiful voice of some holy unseen thing thus sung
soothingly to her sorrow:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">When the thunder-bolt cleaveth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The trembling sky&mdash;<br />
When the mad ocean heaveth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wild waves on high&mdash;<br />
When the coiling snake waketh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the heaving earth curled<br />
And upreareth and shaketh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An agonised world&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">When his coil thrice he foldeth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the night-born,<br />
Till the gazer beholdeth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Red blood fill her horn&mdash;<br />
When Valkyries scatter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds which they tear,<br />
And their steed hoof&rsquo;s loud clatter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is heard in the air&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">When on oak tops the trampling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their hoofs echo loud,<br />
While their snorting and champing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is lost in the cloud&mdash;<br />
When wizards are breaking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sleep of the dead,<br />
And the shadows are waking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From each gory bed&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>When the dog of hell howleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the sheeted dead glide<br />
Where the queen of death scowleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grim Fenris beside&mdash;<br />
When Surter assembleth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lost round his throne&mdash;<br />
Then the murderer trembleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the murderer alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">But then, guiltless beauty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What hast thou to fear?<br />
All owe thee their duty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All homage thee here:<br />
The life thou hast given<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The immortals will claim;<br />
And Rinda in heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stamps thy star-written name.</p>
<p>The princess listened in breathless astonishment, and, when
the sweet sounds died away, spoke in cheerful tones to the
friendly singer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks, gentle magician,&rdquo;
said she aloud; &ldquo;I submit to the pleasure of Odin, and will
not be ungrateful for thy anxiety; see, I will partake of thy
hospitality, and then retire to rest confident in thy gracious
protection.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda then ate something of the
repast, and the moment she had concluded, the dishes and bowls
retired of themselves from the table, without any assistance,
through the doors and windows of the palace.&nbsp; While she was
lost in astonishment at this singular attendance, the doors on
the opposite side of the hall opened of themselves, and she,
supposing it a summons for her attention, immediately passed
through them, and heard them close behind her.&nbsp; She
traversed several stately rooms, till at length she stood in one
more magnificent than the rest, and which, from the circumstance
of the doors closing when she entered it, she concluded was
designed by her host for her chamber.&nbsp; Grateful for his
indulgence, she determined <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>to accept his courtesy, and threw
herself down upon her couch to sleep: satisfied, she reviewed the
events of the day, and found she had little reason to
complain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could even be happy,&rdquo; said
Ildegarda, &ldquo;if I were assured of the safety of my
father.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wish was instantly gratified; a large
curtain on the opposite side was suddenly withdrawn, and,
represented on a magic mirror, the princess beheld her father in
his own palace, conversing earnestly with his attendants.&nbsp;
The vision lasted but a few moments&mdash;the curtain fell again
before the mirror, and Ildegarda, in a transport of gratitude,
thanked aloud the courteous monster, who thus sought, as he had
promised, to offer her the homage most pleasing to her
feelings.</p>
<p>Ildegarda now tried to compose her spirits to sleep,&mdash;the
pale moon had risen over the island, and was pouring a flood of
calm cold light into each apartment of the
palace,&mdash;suddenly, her beams were eclipsed by a light so
glorious that the senses of the princess ached as she
contemplated the wonder; she looked up to discover the cause, but
mortality drooped under its excess of glory, and she bent
downwards towards the earth; a soft voice called upon her name,
but the princess could not reply; then the beautiful being, who
was resting upon the light, beheld the embarrassment of her
beloved, and, dismissing part of the effulgence by which she was
surrounded, stood visible to the mortal sight, and Ildegarda
beheld her beloved goddess, the guardian of her youth, the divine
object of her innocent worship, the radiant Rinda, the daughter
of the sun, the beloved of Odin and Freya.</p>
<p>Ildegarda bent her brow still lower to the <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>earth, and
kissed the fringe of the mantle of her goddess; then the most
lovely of those lovely beings, who float on their ether thrones
round the domes of Valasciolf, spoke tenderly to the fairest of
her worshippers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast done well and
wisely,&rdquo; said the daughter of heaven to the child of earth,
&ldquo;in thus offering thy life for thy father and thy country,
and thou hast not disappointed my hope; I carried up the perfume
of the holy deed to the foot of the throne of Odin; pleased, he
took it from my hand, clothed it in light, and placing it on a
branch of Hydrasil, the tree of heaven, bade it blow and expand
into an immortal flower, to commemorate thy virtue, and remind
him of thy deserving.&nbsp; Child of my love&mdash;hope
all&mdash;fear nothing&mdash;endure with patience&mdash;and thy
reward shall be most glorious.&rdquo;&nbsp; The goddess then
recalled around her the extended beams of light, and,
concentrating their brightness round her person, again became
insupportably effulgent to human vision; in the next instant she
was gone, and the glory she had left died away when unfed by her
presence.</p>
<p>How sweet was the sleep of Ildegarda that night, and how
blessed was her awakening on the morrow!&nbsp; Morning, the gay
bride of Balder, beheld her descend joyfully to the hall, after
adorning her lovely person with an elegant dress, selected from
many, which the unseen hands of her watchful attendants had
placed in her apartment for that purpose.&nbsp; Arrived in the
hall, she expressed a wish to breakfast; and instantly the
courteous dishes glided in from doors and windows to the table,
attended by a grave-looking bowl of milk, which steadily sailed
on till it placed itself in the centre, where it remained till <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>the
princess, by rising from table, dismissed its services for the
present.&nbsp; She then roamed through the vast gardens of this
beautiful place, and talked to the birds and the deer, fondly
hoping and expecting that they were enchanted princes and
princesses, and, like the black horse whom she beheld on her
arrival, endowed with the faculty of speech; but, after much
conversation on her own part, she was compelled to resign this
pleasing illusion, and believe that they were merely real birds
and real deer, who could only sing and leap.&nbsp; She then
returned to the palace, wandered over its spacious apartments,
and amused herself by counting the passages and doors.&nbsp;
Still the day went off heavily, even with the aid of these
time-killing pastimes; and when the hour of supper arrived, the
princess welcomed it as sincerely as if hunger had been the
instigator of the pleasure her countenance expressed; she seated
herself at the table, and was earnestly and anxiously employed in
coaxing the birds to partake of it,&mdash;when a loud clap of
thunder shook the palace to its foundation, and terrified all
appetite from the poor princess.&nbsp; She had hardly time to
think of its cause, ere it became apparent, for the monster-man
himself entered the hall, and clad in his customary dress, stood
still in the middle of the apartment.&nbsp; Although his
appearance was as usual, yet his manner was entirely different,
for his step was slow and irresolute, and his voice mild and
timid; he scarcely ventured to look up as he asked, in a humble
and supplicating manner, if the princess would permit him to pay
his duty while she supped.&nbsp; Ildegarda, somewhat re-assured
by his gentleness, requested him to use his pleasure in a place
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>where
unquestionably all things were at his disposal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
so, gracious lady,&rdquo; replied the courteous monster; &ldquo;I
will not stay in your presence, but with your express permission:
my power I cede to your beauty and virtue, and am content myself
to be the first subject of so lovely a sovereign.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This gallant speech was made with so much humility and respect,
that Ildegarda was not alarmed by its tenderness; and the
monster, to shew (after she had granted permission) how highly he
valued this trifling favour, and how little he was disposed to
encroachment, declined the seat which, after a struggle, she
offered him, and seated himself upon the ground, at a
considerable distance from her.&nbsp; Touched by this humble
homage and generous delicacy of a being so powerful, and at whose
mercy she so entirely was, the princess so far conquered her
abhorrence, as to present him with food and drink; the former he
declined, but he took the again-summoned bowl of milk from her
snowy hand, and, with a gesture of respectful gratitude, tasted
the balmy liquor, as if to indulge her wish.&nbsp; At length,
after a long silence, he asked her if she could be happy in the
island? &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied the princess; &ldquo;But
will you tell me, sir sorcerer, what has thus singularly changed
my destiny?&nbsp; I came hither to die&mdash;yet I
live,&mdash;and anxiety is even manifested by my enemy for my
happiness.&nbsp; How am I to understand these
contradictions?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Call me not your enemy,
beautiful Ildegarda,&rdquo; replied the monster, &ldquo;for that
I have not been; destiny had decreed you to be a victim, though
not of death; I am but its instrument to work out its intentions;
the sacrifice of your liberty only was demanded, and your
generous resignation of life <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>itself has impelled me to love your
worth, and lighten, as far as my power will, the burthen of your
sorrows.&nbsp; I cannot release you from this rock, but I can
surround you with pleasures, and render your bondage
supportable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda was pleased with this
explanation, and, after thanking her host for his generous
intentions, withdrew to her chamber, though not till she had
accorded to Brandomann (for that he had told her was his name)
permission to attend her on the next evening to supper: this was
an honour she would gladly have declined,&mdash;but she felt it
would be ungracious, and that he had some right to calculate upon
her complaisance.&nbsp; The next night came, and Brandomann was
punctual&mdash;conducting himself in the same timid
manner&mdash;though, observing the dislike of Ildegarda towards
him, he put an end to the interview earlier than usual, and
quitted her presence in sorrow.&nbsp; The princess was sad that
she had inflicted pain, yet she could not but hope that the
hideous being would not again seek her society.&nbsp; In this she
was disappointed;&mdash;he came at night, as before, and seated
himself silent and sorrowfully at her feet; he spoke not, and
scarcely ventured to look at her, till she, affected by his
grief, offered him the bowl and bade him drink; he took it with a
smile&mdash;the poor monster intended it so, but the frightful
grin which distorted his features was so odious, that Ildegarda
sickened with affright, and heartily repented her
condescension.&nbsp; Brandomann understood her disgust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ildegarda,&rdquo; he said mournfully, &ldquo;I too well
know how justly I must be an object of abhorrence to the eye of
beauty; I will not give you pain therefore&mdash;though it will
destroy the only happiness I have <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>ever enjoyed, I will intrude no more
into your presence,&mdash;I will not destroy the little felicity
which fate has left you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He arose to retire; but the
generosity of the princess overcame her reluctance,&mdash;she was
not proof against his noble self-denial,&mdash;and, rising
hastily from her seat, she requested, entreated,&mdash;nay,
commanded him to continue his visits.&nbsp; Brandomann was but
too happy to obey; and he retired comforted from her
presence.&nbsp; The next night Brandomann was not so
silent&mdash;he exerted himself to amuse and interest his lovely
prisoner; and he succeeded admirably when he spoke of the present
state of Denmark&mdash;the disorders of the king&mdash;the
disappearance of both the princes, sons of Harold&mdash;and the
courage and integrity of her noble father; upon this theme he
discoursed till tears of pleasure filled the eyes of the
princess, whom he repeatedly assured of Haquin&rsquo;s
safety.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should you wish a confirmation of the
intelligence which I give you,&rdquo; continued Brandomann,
&ldquo;on the first day of every month examine the magic mirror
in your chamber; it will satisfy your curiosity, by representing
your father and his employments; but only at that time must you
consult it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still Brandomann continued to talk, and
Ildegarda to listen, till she forgot to wish for the hour of
separation, and even suffered the monster to retire first; the
next day she grew weary ere evening, and waited with something
like impatience for the supper hour: it came at last, and
Brandomann with it, who perceived, by the reception she gave him,
that he was no longer so unwelcome a guest as formerly.&nbsp;
Animated by this belief, he again exerted all his powers to
interest the princess; he related to her <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>the early
history of her country, and the exploits of the greatest heroes,
her ancestors of the race of Odin; he then went on to discourse
of the Scaldres, their singular union, their mystic occupations,
and their magnificent poems; he himself, he remarked to her, was
of this privileged order, and, without wearying her attention,
recited some of his own composition and those of his noble
brethren.&nbsp; Ildegarda was charmed by his discourses.&nbsp;
Balder had touched his lips with eloquence, and Brage had
rendered his voice melodious, and many words flowed over his
lips, sweet, yet powerful, as a torrent of silvery waters.&nbsp;
The princess was pleased while she only listened,&mdash;when she
looked, the spell was broken.</p>
<h3>PART III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE GUESTS.</span></h3>
<blockquote><p>Misery acquaints a man with strange
bedfellows.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> after day thus glided on
without much variation, though not so heavily as formerly.&nbsp;
One evening Brandomann said to her, &ldquo;Your mornings must
still be wearisome to you; perhaps it might give you pleasure to
travel around this little island; when such shall be your wish,
summon aloud your carriage, with the snow-white deer, (that which
brought you hither,) and it will instantly attend your
command.&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess was impatient, till the next
morning gave her an opportunity of indulging this new
pleasure;&mdash;for <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>when our pleasures are few, every
little variation is hailed as a new one;&mdash;she sprung lightly
from her couch, and, with beaming eyes and a throbbing heart,
ascended her chariot, which, at her wish, waited at the gates of
the marble palace.&nbsp; For some hours she was delighted to be
borne swiftly by the coursers of light through flowery vales and
blooming gardens; but at length grew weary of the silence and
monotony which every where surrounded her, and the inability to
utter or reply to an observation.&nbsp; The deer looked at her
with their intelligent eyes, and seemed to understand her
feelings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, turn then, my lovely deer,&rdquo; she
replied in answer to their silent interrogatory; &ldquo;bear me
again to my home.&rdquo;&nbsp; She entered the marble hall.&nbsp;
It was many days since she no longer startled at the clap of
thunder which announced the approach of Brandomann, and now she
heard it with pleasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have been amused
to-day,&rdquo; said he to her as he entered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
much,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;although I blush to say so; I
would be happy if I could, yet I cannot help feeling that
solitude is melancholy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! yes,&rdquo;
replied the lord of the Maelstrom; &ldquo;but there are
companions to whom it is preferable.&nbsp; If I did not fear
offending by my presumption.&rdquo;&mdash;He was eagerly
interrupted by Ildegarda, who accepted the embryo offer with
delight; and her manner had such an effect upon the monster, that
again the princess repented her condescension.&nbsp; He made
ample amends for his hideous joy, however, on the following day,
when attending Ildegarda on her journey, by his timid and gentle
modesty.&nbsp; Mounted on his coal-black steed, he respectfully
followed her brilliant chariot, and never, except in answer to
her summons, <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>ventured to approach her side.&nbsp; The princess was
naturally generous, and this conduct secured her
confidence.&nbsp; She now encouraged him to converse, called him
frequently to her side, and took pleasure in calling forth and
listening to his observations.&nbsp; On their return to the
palace, a huge raven flew down from a tree upon the shoulder of
Brandomann, and whispered something in his ear; the latter
immediately turned to Ildegarda: &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the only friends who ever enliven this solitude by
visiting me, are now on the island; will you permit them to
attend you at supper?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda consented joyfully:
the thought of once more seeing human beings filled her spirit
with rapture; and, hastening to her apartment, she spent the
intervening time in dressing her lovely person to the utmost
advantage, not only for her own sake, but also to do honour to
the taste and generosity of Brandomann, who had been most lavish
in his preparations for her toilet.&nbsp; At length she
descended, and, with a palpitating heart, entered the hall.&nbsp;
At the door she was met by Brandomann himself, who courteously
led her forward to present her to his guests&mdash;they rose to
receive her&mdash;but imagine the astonishment of
Ildegarda!&mdash;No words can do justice to her surprise, as she
surveyed the assembled party: neither knight nor lady, spirit nor
fiend, greeted her entrance,&mdash;but on one side stood an
enormous wild boar&mdash;on the other a beautiful white
she-goat&mdash;in front stood the eight-legged steed of
Odin&mdash;and the two ravens, whom she had seen on her landing
on the island, had perched themselves with infinite gravity upon
Brandomann&rsquo;s club.&nbsp; The princess turned to her friend,
and was about to demand an explanation, <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>when she
was prevented by the beautiful goat, who, with an air at once
kind and dignified, welcomed her to the island, which she said
was happy under the government of the good Brandomann, the
favourite of Odin, and whom all good spirits loved: the boar made
her his best bow&mdash;Sleipner assured her of his
devotion&mdash;the ravens were happy in the honour of her
acquaintance&mdash;and Ildegarda, after replying to each of these
extraordinary visitors, recovered something of her composure, and
smilingly sat down to supper with her company.&nbsp; She was
about to apologise for the want of proper fare, when she beheld
them supplied with their own particular dishes by the same unseen
attendants who so assiduously waited upon her.&nbsp; Oats and
hay, in a silver manger, were placed before Sleipner&mdash;a huge
tray of nuts and acorns sallied in, and stood stationary at the
tusks of the boar&mdash;a salad was the supper of the white
goat&mdash;and a raw beef-steak was provided for the
accommodation of the ravens.&nbsp; The princess began to be
amused with her situation and company, and listened to their
conversation with considerable interest: Mumin and Hugo, the
raven messengers of Odin, were talking over some of the
divinities of Asgard; and Sleipner mentioned a journey which Thor
the Thunderer intended shortly to take upon his back, to correct
the impious inhabitants of Jutland, who, since the ascension of
the murderer Feggo to his brother&rsquo;s throne, had totally
neglected his worship.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is the murdered prince in
Asgard?&rdquo; demanded Brandomann.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has a
magnificent palace in Valasciolf,&rdquo; replied the huge boar,
&ldquo;where he resides among the other heroes and the divine
family and ministers of Odin, and <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>with them usually spends his nights
at the banquet in Valhalla; but he is not a favourite warrior
there: if he was no more amiable on earth than he is in heaven, I
am not surprised at his wife&rsquo;s wishing to get rid of
him.&nbsp; Hamlet is also there, and almost as unpopular as his
father.&nbsp; Can you imagine it possible, he spends all his time
with Forsete at Glitner, and has grown so wise and disputacious,
that he is continually instructing Odin himself; nay, the other
morning, just before the sounding for the combat, he spoke so
learnedly to that blind Horror, whom we dare not name out of
heaven, and who is already sufficiently inclined to mischief,
that Thor, provoked, lifted up his mallet to knock out the shadow
of his brains,&mdash;but Balder interfered, and his eloquence and
Lofna&rsquo;s smile restored peace to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how go on the happy Scaldres;&rdquo; demanded
Brandomann; &ldquo;what is become of the unlucky Hiarn, whose
skill in singing gained him a crown?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
singer-in-chief in Valhalla,&rdquo; replied Sleipner; &ldquo;and
indeed his strains well deserve this distinction.&nbsp; But
see,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;the princess looks to you for an
explanation: take your harp, Brandomann, and let it tell the
story of Hiarn.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I obey you,&rdquo; replied
the lord of the Maelstrom; and caught up his harp and
sung&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE LEGEND OF HIARN.</p>
<p class="poetry">The heart of the monarch was savage and
wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his red hand with life-blood was gory;<br />
He spared not the matron, he spared not the child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proud youth, nor the head that was hoary.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>Then Hiarn arose&mdash;and his melody&rsquo;s voice,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As over the wild harp it swept,<br />
Brought relief to the land, bade its nobles rejoice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the dark monarch listened&mdash;and wept!</p>
<p class="poetry">And his sorrow was holy, for into his heart<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those tones tender pity had flung&mdash;<br />
And Fate whisper&rsquo;d, &ldquo;Thy soul shall with music
depart&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So he died, while the sweet harper sung.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Hiarn was king&mdash;for the fierce nobles
came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Subdued by his powers alone,<br />
They crowned his bright brow, proclaimed his great name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lowlily knelt at his throne.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Hiarn was king, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alackaday!&rdquo; said the boar, who did not appear to
have any very great taste for music, and who was beginning
besides to be weary of Brandomann&rsquo;s dismal ditty;
&ldquo;alas! for the poor harper; it is a pity, after such a
glorious opening, the close of his history should have been so
dismal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; demanded
Ildegarda; &ldquo;tell me, I pray you, what was the fate of
Hiarn?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A prince of the blood,&rdquo; replied
the courteous boar, &ldquo;the warrior Fridleff, who did not
understand music, challenged the crown from Hiarn: he was too
good a musician to make any thing but a contemptible soldier, so,
as might have been expected, he sunk under the first blow of
Fridleff.&nbsp; But, grieve not for him, charming princess, he is
well rewarded for his short period of suffering; a throne in
Asgard&mdash;a palace dome in Valasciolf&mdash;are surely higher
blessings than even reigning in
Denmark&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Serimnor!&rdquo; said the white goat,
interrupting the conversation, and pointing with her horns to the
stars, which were now rapidly gemming the heavens; &ldquo;see,
the lights in the palaces of Asgard are lit&mdash;the deities and
heroes are on their way to Valhalla&mdash;let us not keep them
waiting, but hasten to supper, lest we should offend the Highest
by our presumption.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus saying, she departed, after
<a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>a
friendly good-night to the princess, and a promise to spend many
evenings with her in the island.&nbsp; Serimnor, deeply engaged
at that moment in a dispute with Brandomann about the politics of
Jutland, did not remark her departure, but was reminded of it, to
the no small astonishment of Ildegarda, in a very extraordinary
manner; a gigantic pair of hands, the right brandishing an
enormous carving knife, coolly entered the folding doors, and,
seizing the throat of the luckless Serimnor, without any sort of
notice or preparation, cut it from one side to the other, just as
he was pronouncing the names of Harwendil and Feggo, which, from
the suddenness of this man&oelig;uvre, burst through the gaping
orifice in his throat, instead of by the usual channel of
communication&mdash;the mouth.&nbsp; The terror of Ildegarda, who
had begun to esteem the polite and obliging Serimnor, was greatly
increased by the extraordinary coolness of Brandomann, who stood
looking on as if nothing particular had happened, and only
discontinued his speech when the body of the poor boar was
dragged from the apartment by the murderous pair of hands.&nbsp;
It seemed as if the whole party had been in a conspiracy to
frighten the timid Ildegarda; for, on the disappearance of the
boar, Sleipner started up, and, snorting till fire darted from
his nostrils and eyes, sprung up into the air, and pawing, and
dashing, and foaming, ascended up to the clouds through the roof
of the palace, which parted to give him passage,&mdash;while the
two ravens flew screaming out of the window.&nbsp; Brandomann had
disappeared in the bustle, and, as he did not attend her on the
following morning, she waited with much uneasy impatience for an
explanation in the evening: this was given by <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>the
good-natured boar himself, who had marked her anxiety, and
hurried first to the palace in order to relieve it.&nbsp; He
thanked her for the interest she took in what appeared to be his
suffering; &ldquo;But grieve not, loveliest of maidens,&rdquo;
said the gallant beast, &ldquo;at an event which is to me but the
consummation of my glory: every night thus I die without pain,
and my flesh is served up to the banquet of the gods,&mdash;while
my spirit enjoys a blissful sleep, from which it awakes in the
morning to animate the same form in which it was clothed the day
before.&nbsp; The beautiful goat whom you saw, is the immortal
Heidruna, whose milk is the hydromel served up to the table of
Odin.&nbsp; She alone, last night, was punctual to her
engagement, while the rest of the party, enchanted by your
beauty, forgot the hour, and had some difficulty to reach
Valhalla in time to avoid the reproach of Odin.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Scarcely was this explanation given, ere Heidruna herself
entered, attended by the ravens and Sleipner, who apologised for
their hasty departure the evening before; and a moment after, the
clap of thunder announced the approach of Brandomann.&nbsp; The
whole party now sat contentedly down to supper, infinitely
pleased with themselves and each other; and perhaps it would have
been difficult to find one more happy, or its members bearing
more sincere good will towards each other.&nbsp; The next day was
the first of the month, and the princess hastened to avail
herself of the magic gift of Brandomann.&nbsp; With intense
anxiety she raised the curtain, and her heart throbbed with
delight to behold her father in health and spirits, well armed,
and travelling, attended by a band of gallant warriors, who
appeared to be anxious for his safety.&nbsp; Ildegarda <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>looked at
him with rapture, and new feelings of gratitude to Brandomann
gave the evening which followed this happy morning, fresh charms
in her eyes, and made her confinement in the desolate island,
with none but the ugliest of orangutangs for a constant
companion, no longer either gloomy or dreadful.</p>
<p>One morning, while surveying together the beauties of the
island in a sentimental walk, Brandomann asked the princess if
she had now entirely resigned herself to the lot of total
seclusion in the island of the Maelstrom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may, and
do sometimes regret the halls of my fathers,&rdquo; replied the
tender Ildegarda.&nbsp; &ldquo;But when I reflect from what
miseries my devotion has preserved my beloved country, and still
more beloved father, I feel that I ought not to complain.&nbsp;
Neither am I insensible of what I owe to you; and I acknowledge
that, without any other motive, your generous protection of me
and care of my happiness deserves the sacrifice even of these
regrets: I am willing to make it, and should even rejoice in an
opportunity that would allow me to convince you of my
sincerity.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have, then, (and permit me to
say I hope it,) banished from your heart the remembrance of
Haldane?&rdquo; said the monster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! no,&rdquo;
replied Ildegarda, bursting into tears of tenderness at his
recollection; &ldquo;that can I never do; and it is the certainty
of his loss that enables me so well to support this destiny: but
do not let this disturb you&mdash;the recollection of Haldane
will never interrupt my gratitude to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you could resolve upon fresh sacrifices if they were demanded of
you?&rdquo; inquired Brandomann.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could,&rdquo;
replied the princess.&nbsp; Brandomann paused&mdash;he looked <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>sadly and
earnestly, at Ildegarda, and then, as with a violent effort,
flung himself at her feet, and tremblingly demanded,
&ldquo;Princess, will you become my wife?&rdquo;&nbsp; A shriek
of horror, and a look of unmeasured abhorrence, was the only
reply of the hapless Ildegarda; and too plainly these tokens
spoke to the unfortunate Brandomann.&nbsp; He calmed his
agitation&mdash;arose from her feet, and spoke kindly and
steadily to tranquillise her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not hate me,
beautiful sovereign of my destiny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
thus I am compelled to add to your inquietudes.&nbsp; Yet be not
alarmed needlessly; I adore you, but no force shall be put upon
your inclinations: forgive me, if, impelled by a power I dare not
disobey, I am sometimes obliged to give you pain by this
question.&nbsp; But fear not&mdash;my wishes shall be sacrificed
to yours&mdash;I would not receive that hand, dear as it would
be, unless voluntarily presented by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess took courage at this declaration of her hideous
lover.&nbsp; She knew he was a monster of his word; and she
thought if he would not receive her hand till she presented it,
she should be safe from the infliction of such a husband.&nbsp;
Assuring him, therefore, that she was far from hating him, and
expressing with warmth the sentiments she really felt for her
grim admirer, the poor monster was somewhat comforted, which
Ildegarda was not sorry to remark; for if Brandomann was ugly
when he was gay, he was ten thousand times more so when in
sorrow.&nbsp; They returned to the palace in tolerable spirits,
and in the evening Ildegarda took an opportunity of depositing
her perplexities in the bosom of the respectable white goat, for
whom she began to experience something of filial affection.&nbsp;
Heidruna <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>consoled the princess by her unqualified praises of the
honour and sincerity of Brandomann, and her firm conviction that
Ildegarda would never be molested by his fondness; although
Heidruna thought, and could not help telling her young friend,
that in the world she might have matched herself with many a
greater beast than Brandomann: but, as this was entirely a matter
of opinion, she rather soothed the princess than contradicted
her.&nbsp; The good Serimnor interrupted the
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, and fully seconded the
opinion of Heidruna, both as to the honour and goodness of the
lord monster of Moskoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;You observe,&rdquo; said he
to Ildegarda, &ldquo;that he has been admitted among the
Scaldres, an order which generally requires perfection from its
aspirants; and great must his virtues be, when the unbounded
ugliness of his person could not outweigh them, nor conceal the
richness and beauty of his mind.&nbsp; He is also, as we are, the
descendant of Odin, and peculiarly favoured by the mightiest of
the gods, and his son Thor, the thunderbolt: he enjoys extensive
power, and many prerogatives not granted to the more beautiful
children of nature, to compensate for the imprisonment of such a
spirit in so hideous and detestable a frame.&nbsp; Were it
possible to overcome your natural repugnance, you would have no
reason to regret the change; but should your aversion be
invincible, you will have nothing to fear, since he will continue
to you the tenderest and humblest of lovers, and we shall always
remain your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess thanked the friendly boar for his kind assurance,
and they separated for the night in increased good will towards
each other.&nbsp; In a few days after this conversation,
Brandomann <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>sought the princess in her chamber.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
storm is gathering above the whirlpool,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;its effects will be terrific&mdash;our friends are
collected to watch its progress&mdash;shall we follow them to the
coast?&nbsp; If it will interest you, I will raise my magic tent
upon the top of the highest rock, and, sheltered even from the
slightest drops of rain, you shall see the storm in its terrors,
and the fiends unseen of mortal eyes, who increase its horrors
and sport in its bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda accepted the
invitation, and the rein-deer swiftly bore their light and lovely
burthen to the rocks, accompanied by Brandomann, whose
eight-legged steed would far have outstripped the nimble coursers
of the princess, but for the frequent checks of his rider.&nbsp;
Arrived at the point of rock, they beheld the waters raging
around them, (for the island was seated in the midst of the
gulf,) but with less violence than Ildegarda had expected: she
remarked this to her attendant.&nbsp; &ldquo;The waters are now
at their height,&rdquo; replied Brandomann; &ldquo;and for one
quarter of an hour it will be tolerably calm, but the power of
the storm will be tremendous when that short interval shall be
past: many, deceived by the calm, venture out while it lasts, and
encounter certain destruction at its close.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ildegarda continued watching for the termination of the delusive
calm, when her meditations were interrupted by the arrival of
Heidruna, Serimnor, and the ravens: they arranged themselves
round the chariot of the princess, and, protected from the storm
by the magic tent of Brandomann, stood watching its progress in
silent anxiety.&nbsp; The deceitful calm, as the lord of the
island had predicted, was of no long duration.&nbsp; In a few
minutes the brightness of Balder <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>was entirely obscured; the wind
chorus began, and swept low and sullenly over the waters, which
now rose upwards, gently murmuring, as if they were the echoes of
the distant song.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen, Ildegarda,&rdquo; said
Brandomann; &ldquo;to you it is given to hear the secrets and
wonders of the earth, in recompense for being thus shut out from
its more social intercourse: listen, and you will hear the
unknown song of the winds: hark! how it rises from an
immeasurable distance, and yet you can distinguish their voices,
and the words they utter.&nbsp; Now they come
nearer&mdash;hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE SONG OF THE WINDS.</p>

And the crash of falling towers,<br />

Blow winds, blow! to heaven ascending,<br />
Clashing, crashing, crushing, rending,<br />
Wrath on earth and ocean pouring,<br />
O&rsquo;er the scared world, raging, roaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm is indeed terrific now,&rdquo; said
Ildegarda; &ldquo;I can almost see it in the air, as it scatters
the clouds before it: look how the waters rise to meet it,
roaring with the fury and force of the cataract!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Amid the uproar, she thought she distinguished other noises than
those of the tempest&mdash;a sound like the howls and shrieks of
pain: she noticed the circumstance to Brandomann.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;look yonder,
where a desperate battle is waging, in despite of this scene of
tempest.&nbsp; A bear has swum from this mountain territory of
Hilseggen to prey upon the flocks of Suarven, one of the few
islands in this gulf which is inhabited; a single gallant
shepherd has attacked him, but I fear the bear has the mastery:
see! the shepherd has lost his staff, and the monster grapples
with him closely&mdash;he hugs him fiercely!&mdash;Is there no
way by which I can save him?&nbsp; What, ho!
shepherd!&mdash;what, ho!&mdash;loosen yourself from the grasp of
your enemy and fly&mdash;stand on the very edge of the rock, and
let him spring against you!&mdash;So, <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>so&mdash;the fellow fears me no less
than the bear, yet he obeys&mdash;he is crouching&mdash;his enemy
runs&mdash;plunges&mdash;ah! ah!&mdash;he has lost his balance
and dashes headlong into the stream&mdash;well, run,
shepherd!&mdash;He stays not to sing the death-song for his
foe.&mdash;Good night, friend bear, you will sup with the fish of
the Maelstrom to-night!&rdquo;&nbsp; While they looked on, they
beheld the savage animal struggling for his life against the
dreadful current, but in vain; borne onward, despite of his
roarings, he was soon over the terrible pool, and then whirled
rapidly round, till he was sucked down into the bosom of the
dismal gulf, which, sages have written, penetrates the
globe.&nbsp; Ildegarda pitied the poor bear, whose love of mutton
had occasioned him so miserable a fate; but a new wonder now
claimed her attention and diverted her thoughts from his sorrows:
this was another island, slowly arising from the bottom of the
lake, and covered with sea-weeds, becoming stationary at no great
distance from Moskoe.&nbsp; Before Ildegarda could point it out
to her companions, Serimnor advanced hastily towards
Brandomann.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is mischief abroad, dear
brother,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;this storm is not of
Niord&rsquo;s raising.&nbsp; Some friend beloved of Odin, and
abhorred of Lok, is certainly in danger; for look who are
sporting in the tempest.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed to the bosom of
the gulf and to the rocky shore of Otterholm.&nbsp; In the centre
of the one, Ildegarda beheld the head of a monstrous serpent
reared above the waves, and surveying with fiery eyes the distant
sea; and on the other a hideous wolf, with his attention fixed in
the same direction, and howling in concert with the storm.&nbsp;
The princess shuddered, and, for the first time in her life, drew
<a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>nearer
to Brandomann for protection.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have nothing to
fear, dearest,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from these monsters whom
you behold; they are indeed your foes and mine, for they are the
children of Lok, and the enemies of Odin; but they have no power
over you, and mine, by the gift of their conqueror, is greater
than their own.&nbsp; He whom you see in the waters is the giant
snake, whose folds of sin encircle the guilty earth, and who now,
from its centre, is bidding defiance to some noble foe of his
evil father.&nbsp; Fenris, the wolf-dog, guard of hell, appears
only when mischief is in the air, to increase, by his cries and
the horror of his form, the fears and the danger of his
victim.&nbsp; I deem some hapless vessel has approached too near
this coast during the calm, and now the storm will drag it to
destruction.&nbsp; But let us watch&mdash;Hugo and Mumin, stretch
out your pinions&mdash;fly over the waters, and tell me what you
descry.&rdquo;&nbsp; The messengers of Odin obeyed&mdash;they
flew over the bosom of the lake&mdash;then out towards the
boundless and ungirt ocean: suddenly they returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A sail! a sail!&rdquo; said Hugo.&nbsp; &ldquo;A gallant
ship!&rdquo; cried Mumin; &ldquo;the whirl has surely caught her,
she comes on so rapidly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon, very soon, she
neared, and drove onwards, visible to all.&nbsp; Brandomann
grasped his club: &ldquo;Some bold adventurers,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;doubtless, who seek to land upon this island in defiance
of the will of Odin; if so, they are lost indeed, for the king of
Valhalla has resigned them to the power of the
infernals.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was frightful to mark the force with
which the ship drove on.&nbsp; &ldquo;They make for the island
which has just risen from the lake,&rdquo; said the
princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Death will too surely greet them
there,&rdquo; replied Brandomann; &ldquo;for that is no <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>land, but
the snare of fiends to beguile; it is the dreadful Kraken, that
monster of the deep, who, when the vessel touches him, will sink,
and draw it with him.&rdquo;&mdash;And the vessel was near the
monster, when a piercing shriek from Ildegarda arrested the
thoughts of Brandomann.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is my father!&rdquo; she
cried&mdash;&ldquo;it is my father!&mdash;I know his
banner&mdash;he seeks me on this island&mdash;have mercy,
Odin!&mdash;Oh, Brandomann, if thou lovest
me&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If I love thee!&mdash;lo! now I disobey
the will of Odin for thee!&mdash;judge, then, how dear thou
art!&rdquo;&nbsp; He started from her side, sprung upon Sleipner,
darted from the rock, and the next instant Ildegarda beheld his
giant form stemming the torrent with a power equal to its
own.&nbsp; The wolf beheld him and ran howling away, while a
single blow from his mighty club drove the grim serpent beneath
the waves, to howl his disappointment in Niftheim.&nbsp;
Ildegarda heard none of the consoling speeches addressed to her
by her friends; her ear&mdash;her eye&mdash;her heart, were all
with Brandomann: she shrieked aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will not
reach it ere it touches the Kraken,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and
then all help will be in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so, dear
princess,&rdquo; replied Serimnor; &ldquo;he acts with the power
of Odin, and will save your father; and then what will not his
generosity deserve?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My life&mdash;my
love!&rdquo; distractedly replied the wretched Ildegarda, totally
incapable of accepting any consolation, and only alive to the
danger of her father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Odin! save him!&rdquo; she
cried; &ldquo;and thou, thou the nameless!&mdash;the mighty in
strength&mdash;the blind invincible&mdash;preserve the faithful
Brandomann!&rdquo;&nbsp; At this instant the Kraken
sunk&mdash;the hoof of Sleipner had touched him&mdash;and
Brandomann sternly approached the vessel: a band of warriors, <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>headed by
her father, prepared to oppose him, and Ildegarda beheld their
bright weapons gleaming above his head.&nbsp; At this sight,
&ldquo;Harm him not,&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;ye know not
whom ye strike!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the next instant shewed her the
folly of her fear and the mighty power of her lover.&nbsp;
Heedless of the flashing swords, Sleipner sprung among the
warriors, whose arms were now useless in their deadened hands,
and Brandomann stood upon the deck, sternly reproving their
presumption, and commanding the gallant ship to return home to
Denmark.&nbsp; The vessel obeyed&mdash;the warriors knew the
eight-legged steed of Odin, and were silent; but Haquin accused
aloud the murderer of his daughter, for he judged he beheld the
lord of the Maelstrom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy daughter lives,&rdquo;
replied the terrible Brandomann; &ldquo;but she is mine: at her
entreaty I have saved thy forfeited life&mdash;but approach no
more the island forbidden by Odin to mortal foot, else will I
resign thee to the fate thy presumption will incur, and which,
but for thy daughter&rsquo;s tears, thou wouldest ere now have
tasted.&nbsp; Hence, Haquin, and learn submission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sleipner plunged into the waters, and the vessel, now removed
beyond the power of the whirlpool, sailed back to Denmark, while
Brandomann returned to Ildegarda, by whom he was received with a
welcome far surpassing his hopes or expectations.&nbsp; He said
nothing, however, of the important service he had just rendered
her; and his delicate conduct, which did not pass unobserved by
the princess, created for him an advocate in her bosom stronger
than his own entreaties, or those of all his friends united,
could have done.&nbsp; She saw how tenderly Brandomann loved her,
but she saw also that he was resolved <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>not to give her pain; and, to say
the truth, she could not help being pleased by this circumstance;
for gratitude, great as it certainly was, was yet not
sufficiently powerful to make so cruel a sacrifice to his
happiness.&nbsp; By the time he had landed, the storm had passed
from the face of heaven, and all was calm upon the bosom of the
waters as if the fiends of Niftheim had not been raging within it
a few moments before; the party returned to sup in the palace,
and all things went on pleasingly as usual.&nbsp; Days, weeks,
passed away, but Ildegarda, no longer wretched in submitting to
the sentence she had once thought so cruel, took little heed of
time, except to notice the first day of the month, which
presented to her anxious eyes the person and occupations of her
father.&nbsp; Twice, successively, she had seen him in his tent,
surrounded by heroes, amid preparations for war; he was cheerful,
and appeared to be encouraging the spirits of a young man, whom
Ildegarda knew to be prince Harold, and who, with a gentle,
downcast look, was listening to his observations: this was
confirmed to her by the accounts of Brandomann, whose cares to
lighten her anxieties and anticipate her wishes sensibly affected
the generous daughter of Haquin.&nbsp; She took increased delight
in his conversation; and he, from whose presence she was at first
so anxious to fly, was now frequently summoned to relieve
solitude by his cheering conversation.&nbsp; She was herself
surprised at the change; and could she have shut from her bosom
the thought of her early and beautiful love.&nbsp; Brandomann,
even in person, would not have been disgusting.&nbsp; As it was,
he daily grew less odious, and daily grew the princess more
contented <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>with her lot; the happy society of the marble palace
met nightly, and mirth, and song, and tale, gave wings to the
cheerful hours.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> night when the conversation
particularly turned upon the exploits of the ancestors of
Ildegarda, Sleipner, who possessed a natural love of noble
actions, inquired of the boar whether king Uffon was constant in
his attendance upon the nightly festival of the hall of
Odin?&nbsp; &ldquo;He is so, frequently,&rdquo; replied Serimnor;
&ldquo;but he takes more delight in the combat of the
morning&mdash;from that he is never absent:&mdash;but what an
extraordinary history is his!&rdquo; continued the boar;
&ldquo;it is necessary that he should be in Asgard, for its
inhabitants to believe it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda&rsquo;s
attention was aroused; she had never heard of her ancestor, and
she entreated Brandomann to indulge her curiosity.&nbsp; He took
up his harp immediately&mdash;for he appeared to have no
occupation so delightful as to obey her slightest wish&mdash;and
thus related to her the legend of Uffon the Merciful:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, truly,&rdquo; said Serimnor, on the conclusion of
the legend; &ldquo;that would be quite impossible either for
heaven or earth; but glory to the good Uffon&mdash;few warriors
in Valhalla are more esteemed <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>than he.&nbsp; The skull of the
impious Saxon is now his drinking cup; and his father, restored
to sight, beholds the pledge of victory with undying felicity:
and, in the combats and martial sports of the morning, the battle
between his noble son and the Saxon is daily renewed, to gladden
him with the sound of conquest and triumph over his shadowy
foe.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look, Serimnor,&rdquo; said the horse of
Odin, interrupting him impatiently, as a bright flash of
lightning darted into the hall and played against his head for a
moment; &ldquo;Look, we are again outstaying our time&mdash;the
son of Rinda is shooting his brilliant arrows, and one has
already touched you: let us obey the summons, and not provoke him
to make his fatal shafts unerring.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Away,
then!&rdquo; cried Heidruna.&nbsp; The ravens flapped their
wings&mdash;Brandomann rose&mdash;and the hall was cleared in a
moment.</p>
<p>Ildegarda had hitherto been happy in the reports of the magic
mirror, and satisfied with its assurances of her father&rsquo;s
safety.&nbsp; On the first of the tenth month of her residence on
the island, she again withdrew the curtain,&mdash;but a different
spectacle awaited her; Haquin was lying wounded upon his couch,
pale and insensible, while his attendants were anxiously
endeavouring to stanch the blood which flowed from his injured
side.&nbsp; The princess became wild with apprehension; instantly
she sought her faithful Brandomann, to pour into his bosom the
grief which distracted hers.&nbsp; He listened with tender
sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;There has been a battle between your
father and Frotho, no doubt,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but though
I am not informed of all the particulars, I know that Haquin will
not die of this wound: take comfort from this <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>assurance,
for when did I ever deceive you?&rdquo;&nbsp; But Ildegarda
refused all consolation, and persisted in thinking and making
herself the most miserable of all human beings.&nbsp; Her father
was ill&mdash;wounded&mdash;in need of her assistance&mdash;and
she herself uncertain of his fate for a whole month at
least.&nbsp; Her anxiety hourly increased, and her grief, too
powerful to be concealed from Brandomann, affected him no less
painfully than herself.&nbsp; It was in vain he exerted his
talents to divert her anguish; she was grateful for his kindness,
but did not shed one tear the less: his conversation had lost its
charms, his tales and songs their interest.&nbsp; Brandomann
discovered this, and, after a terrible struggle, his generous
nature overmastered every selfish and interested feeling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said he at length to the weeping
princess; &ldquo;I cannot bear to witness your sorrow, and know
that I am the cause.&nbsp; For your sake I will again disobey the
command of Odin, which had decreed your captivity to be
perpetual; you shall go to your father: promise me that you will
return hither, and you shall be swiftly conveyed to his
tent&mdash;and remain with him seven days; at the close of that
period you must return, or my life will pay the forfeit of my
fault, and be demanded to appease the anger of Odin.&nbsp; Go,
then, beloved princess,&mdash;but sometimes think of Brandomann,
and what he will suffer for your sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess
could scarcely believe what she heard: in a rapture of joy she
accepted the offer, and was most fervent in her promises to
return at the expiration of seven days.&nbsp; Brandomann sighed
heavily, but made no reply to her frequent protestations of their
soon meeting again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall be with your father
to-morrow morning,&rdquo; <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>said he: &ldquo;merely take this
ring&mdash;put it upon your finger when you go to rest to-night,
and do the same thing when you wish to return to me; but do not
wear it at any other time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess joyfully
accepted the gift&mdash;took an affectionate leave of her admired
monster&mdash;and retired to rest full of hope and
expectation&mdash;expectations which were fully realised on her
awaking in the morning; for she found her couch in her
father&rsquo;s tent, and he himself gazing upon her with tender
anxiety and wonder.</p>
<p>The joy of Haquin, at again folding his beloved child to his
bosom, was considerably damped by the narrative of her
adventures, and the promise which she had given to Brandomann to
return.&nbsp; As he did not deem it possible that she intended to
keep her word, he was not a little astonished at her declaration,
when she assured him she could remain with him only during the
seven days.&nbsp; He argued strongly against her intention; and
she at present, unwilling to distress him, ceased to oppose his
opinions, and occupied herself entirely with the care of his
health, knowing that it would always be in her power to return
whenever she felt the inclination.&nbsp; Her tender attention was
fully appreciated by Haquin, but she herself was far from being
at ease in the midst of a tumultuous camp, where her wishes were
not anticipated with the swift and delighted obedience of her
island attendants: she had no change of dress either: a
circumstance peculiarly vexatious, as she was daily surrounded by
admiring warriors, who constantly paid homage to her
charms,&mdash;and among whom prince Harold was not the least
fervent in his expressions of devotion to her beauty.&nbsp;
Awakening one morning after many regrets <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>upon this
subject to herself overnight, she was surprised to see the chest
which ornamented her chamber at Moskoe, and which contained her
superb wardrobe, standing by the side of her couch: she opened it
hastily: &ldquo;Kind, generous Brandomann, always alike
solicitous for my happiness and pleasure,&rdquo; she exclaimed;
&ldquo;how much do I not owe thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; She immediately
decorated her lovely person and returned to her father, who,
cheered by her presence and renovated by her care, was quickly
recovering from the effects of his wound: he now informed her
that Haldane was universally said to have been murdered by his
uncle; and that, in consequence of their disgust at this act of
cruelty, many noble Danes had resorted to the standard of Harold,
whom they unanimously called to the throne, though they held not
the gentle boy in the same estimation as his more valiant
brother.&nbsp; To this he added, that as the young king had
declared a passion for Ildegarda, he had determined to unite them
despite of the wrath of Frotho, and thus repay her long captivity
by placing her upon a throne.&nbsp; His daughter had many
objections to this arrangement, but her father&rsquo;s heart
appeared to joy so deeply in its contemplation that Ildegarda had
not the courage to undeceive him: the tenderness of Haquin, the
novelty of again seeing human faces, and the pleasure of
listening to the gallant praises of the noble Danes, at length
rendered Ildegarda forgetful of her promise, and not only seven
days, but twice that number slipped away, ere she called to mind
the probable anxiety of Brandomann.&nbsp; She now determined to
repair her fault and hasten back to the island, but when, upon
retiring to rest, she sought her ring to place it <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>upon her
finger, the talisman was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; In great
distress she hastened to her father, expecting him perhaps to
sympathise in her misfortune, but, unlike the gentle monster of
the Maelstrom, he laughed at her anxiety, and congratulated her
upon her loss; he bade her be under no apprehension respecting
her ring, since it was safe in his possession&mdash;he had stolen
it on being informed of its virtue, in order to secure her
company,&mdash;&ldquo;which,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it
appears, without this precaution I should have lost.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He observed that he could not permit such a preposterous union
between beauty and a beast, who, instead of being a descendant of
Odin, was doubtless a member of the infernal royal family of Lok,
and consequently some diabolical sorcerer, who had thus bought
her, body and soul, of Frotho: he would give her, he remarked, a
husband better suited to her rank and beauty, and commanded her
to prepare to espouse the royal cousin Harold, within at least
ten days.&nbsp; Ildegarda was much startled by this conversation;
and she who in the desolate island had mourned over the idea of
perpetual captivity, now wept with more bitterness her recovered
liberty, and the prospect of never more returning to her prison;
she thought of the tender obedience of Brandomann to her lightest
wish, and his generous self-denial upon all occasions respecting
her.&nbsp; She lamented the kind-hearted Serimnor, the chivalrous
horse, the affectionate goat, and even the ravens and reindeer
received the tribute of her tears; but the idea of the probable
suffering of Brandomann for his devotion to her, and disobedience
in her favour, filled her heart with the most poignant regret;
she hated Harold, and she esteemed her Maelstrom <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>friend, and
not a day passed without the severest search for the ring that
was to convey her back to his territories.&nbsp; At length Rinda,
in pity, heard her prayers.&nbsp; In her father&rsquo;s bosom,
during his sleep, she found her glittering ring, which she
hastily secured as her dearest treasure, and instantly retired to
rest; and when morning again looked upon her, it was in her
chamber of the desolate isle.</p>
<p>Ildegarda scarce waited fully to throw off the fetters of
sleep ere she descended to the marble hall, and instantly gave
the signal which used to summon Brandomann to her presence, and
which he had never neglected; now it was unheeded.&nbsp; Alarmed,
she repeated it more strongly&mdash;Brandomann replied not to the
call; half-distracted she hurried through the palace and harrowed
her own feelings by recalling to mind his mournful prediction of
the fate which awaited him, should she exceed her allotted
time.&nbsp; She shuddered to reflect how long that time had
elapsed.&nbsp; From the palace she traversed the gardens, running
wildly with an aching heart and burning brow to every quarter,
and asking every object she met for tidings of her lamented
Brandomann: the birds and the echoes alone replied to her
mournful queries, and disconsolate and despairing she threw
herself upon the sod to give vent to the bitterness of her
sorrow, and lament undisturbed her affliction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brandomann!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;Brandomann! where
art thou? friend of my soul, art thou yet in existence, or hath
my ingratitude destroyed thee?&nbsp; Oh, if thou hearest, if thou
beholdest these tears, have pity on thy wretched Ildegarda, and
hasten to relieve her agony, and pardon her involuntary
crime.&rdquo;&nbsp; She started up in a <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>sudden
ecstasy, for a low groan at no great distance from her seemed to
be an answer to her question; she rushed forward in that
direction, and soon beheld the hapless Brandomann stretched upon
the earth, and apparently in the agonies of death; but her
beloved voice, the touch of her gentle hand, the glance of her
worshipped eye, either of these would have recalled him to life,
and now all were lavishly employed to restore him: he looked up
for a moment.&nbsp; Mournfully he said, &ldquo;Beloved, thou art
come to see me die!&rdquo; and then relapsed into stupor and
forgetfulness.&nbsp; Ildegarda wept in agony&mdash;she was
hanging over him in listless sorrow, when her thoughts were
aroused by the appearance of Heidruna.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brandomann is
dying,&rdquo; said the white goat, &ldquo;and from grief at your
neglect; but you have returned, and, in compassion to your
sufferings, I am permitted to restore him to you: take the bowl
you see yonder, draw forth a portion of my milk, and give it to
his lips; the hydromel of heaven will call him back to
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda obeyed&mdash;she gave the miraculous
draught to Brandomann, who as instantly recovered his reason and
his strength; with tears of joy she expressed her gratitude to
Heidruna; and the Moskoe chief observing her delight, and too
happy once more to behold her, readily forgave her all he had
suffered in her absence.&nbsp; There was much happiness that
night in the marble palace; Sleipner bowed down his arched neck
to receive a pat from her snowy hand; Serimnor grinned till his
huge tusks were completely visible; the ravens presented her the
tips of their wings, and flew screaming about, as if <i>they</i>
had been drinking the hydromel of Valhalla.&nbsp; Ildegarda was
happy, and Brandomann dared not <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>trust his feelings to words.&nbsp;
Sunny walks and moonlight musings were now the pursuits of the
imprisoned pair; for instead of retiring to rest, as formerly,
when the Valhalla people went to their party, they roamed over
the island, contemplating the stars, and talking tenderly of
course, for when were love and moonshine separated?&nbsp; It is
true, in this instance, the tenderness was all on one side; for
though Ildegarda permitted it, since she saw the happiness it
gave to Brandomann, she yet could not prevail upon herself to
return it, or say the words he wished to hear from her
lips.&nbsp; One evening, as thus, in the tranquil moonlight, they
sat alone in the summery isle, Ildegarda was astonished, by the
appearance of a wonder she had never yet remarked in the island;
the moon was suddenly eclipsed by a light so glorious, yet so
soft, that every object around her was visible in the brightness
of beaming gold, yet without giving pain to the sense.&nbsp;
Brandomann remarked her admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;This beauteous
light,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a mark of the approbation of the
father of the gods, at some virtuous action of a favourite of
heaven; it is Odin&rsquo;s fire, dear Ildegarda, the light of his
glorious smile; and shining now as it does upon thee, and our
lonely isle, it comes to tell thee he is satisfied with thy past
conduct, and approves thy present.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scarcely was this
explanation given, ere the beauteous light died away from the
mountains and the palace, and night wore again her solemn robe of
darkness.&nbsp; As they prepared to return, the star-studded sky,
the jewel-paved floor of the palaces of Asgard, sparkling with
its unnumbered lights, and shining in its soft blue glory, struck
on their souls with delight; and, while they were gazing in
rapture, a large and <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>brilliant star shot from its place
in the heaven and vanished rapidly from their sight.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some noble warrior or virtuous sage has closed his eyes
upon this mortal scene,&rdquo; said Brandomann, tenderly:
&ldquo;that was the star of his destiny; it fell from its seat in
the heaven when he quitted his on the earth: this is the sign
that tells to the survivors his fate, if it is fulfilled in the
night; by day it is the vision of the rainbow bridge, the sacred
arch that connects this earth with heaven, and over which the
spirits of the just must pass.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard
that it is only visible to mortal sight, when the peculiarly
brave and virtuous ascend its brilliant road,&rdquo; said
Ildegarda.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you have heard aright,
dearest,&rdquo; replied Brandomann; &ldquo;it is only then that
the guardian spirit of the bridge, Heimdaller of the radiant
brow, descends from his abode on its top to meet and welcome the
traveller; then it is, that the light from his rushing wings, and
the gems which compose his jewelled crown, shine so strongly on
the arch, as to render it visible to mortal sight, clad in the
reflected glories of its guardian&rsquo;s diadem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow Brandomann relieved her anxiety, which had been
awakened by the sight of the falling star, lest her
father&rsquo;s should no more have a seat in the heavens, nor
himself a name on the earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;A mild and gracious
being hath left us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for the happier scenes
of Asgard; Sevald is dead&mdash;the virtuous son of the abandoned
Frotho is no more&mdash;he fell, as became his race, in the
battle-field, contending against your victorious father and his
kinsman Harold, against whom the tyrant rages and vows
destruction, as now the only rival he has to fear.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The princess was satisfied by this explanation, the more
especially as <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>the first day of the month again presented the person
of her father, though surrounded by the bustle of war.</p>
<h3>PART V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ODIN.</span></h3>
<blockquote><p>He hath borne all things well.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>&mdash;<i>Macbeth</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Whence</span> is it,
Brandomann,&rdquo; said Sleipner one evening to the Scaldre,
&ldquo;that among those of the heroes whose virtues and glories
you are nightly celebrating, I never heard the actions of Odin;
why, while thus honouring his friends, are you neglectful of the
great father of our race?&nbsp; Surely he, from whom all
inspiration flows, deserves the best, ay, and the finest fruits
of your genius!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only because I feared
my feeble strains would not do justice to the lofty
subject,&rdquo; replied Brandomann; &ldquo;the glory of the
father of gods and men requires a mightier hand than mine to
celebrate it; Brage alone should strike the golden chord to his
honour&mdash;alone should sing of deeds beyond the feeble thought
of mortality; that which I can, I will; I dare not wake the voice
of song, but I will speak of his wondrous deeds, that to-night,
in Valhalla, thou mayest tell bright Asgard&rsquo;s king that I
have instructed this lovely maiden what honours and love are due
to the first of her race, and the friend of her father.&nbsp;
Will it please thee, Ildegarda, to listen to the legend of
Sigge?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Beyond all other things,&rdquo;
replied the princess, pleasedly: and Brandomann, smiling,
began&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>From
his high and everlasting throne in Valhalla, had Odin, the
dispenser of good, poured forth, with unsparing hand, innumerable
benefits upon his attendant spirits.&nbsp; In the burning
benevolence of his heart he forgot, or he disregarded, that to
some essences obligation is pain, and gratitude a toil; so high
did he raise some of those bright creations that stood nearest to
his throne, that they became too great for obedience, and
impatient of the most gentle restraint.&nbsp; Lok, the most
glorious of these glorious things, seated on the lowest step of
the throne of light, saw but one between him and the highest; and
once on that, what should restrain from him the throne of the
universe?&nbsp; Thus he thought, and thus he did: by his
eloquence he seduced the higher spirits from their duty&mdash;by
his beauty and promises the lower.&nbsp; The worlds of Asgard
sent their governing spirits forth to fight under his banner, and
Surter brought myriads to his side.&nbsp; For the first time
since the creation, the standards of revolt flew in the cities of
Asgard, and the proud Lok drove back, with contempt, the
interceding ministers of Odin, who came to remonstrate upon his
madness.&nbsp; Confident in his power, the giant spirit entered
Valasciolf, the city of the king, and dared even advance to
Valhalla: the immortal beings who surround the diamond throne
shuddered at his presumption, and, veiling their bright heads
from the terrible glances of Odin, wept the approaching destiny
of companions once so beloved, which they read in the eye of
their master: the sovereign of the universe gave no command to
his people&mdash;he uttered no reproach&mdash;he suffered his
faithful spirits to fly before the sword of Lok and the devouring
fires of Surter&mdash;he even permitted the <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>lost ones
to approach the steps of his eternal throne&mdash;then, when with
proud exultation they advanced to seize upon him whose power they
believed departed, he calmly arose from his seat and stretched
out his right hand, armed with its invincible falchion, towards
his enemies: at that tremendous signal Niord let loose the oceans
of heaven, and, in terrific grandeur they came rolling down upon
the revolted; the winds from all the worlds were summoned up to
heaven to aid their master, and rend and scatter his
offenders.&nbsp; Balder deserted his throne in the orb of
day,&mdash;and the mad and governless globe flew up into Asgard,
and burst its destructive flames upon the rebels.&nbsp; Thor, the
first-born of Odin, threw by his star-formed diadem, girded his
brow with the thunder, and, wielding the red bolt of vengeance,
rushed upon them.&nbsp; The sightless horror rose in his terrible
strength, and the arrows of Vile, unerring as the lance of Hela,
flew among the foes: all was confusion, terror, and
despair&mdash;cries of anguish polluted the happy city&mdash;Odin
recalled his warriors, and plunged their enemies in the burning
lake, bidding the proud Lok and the ambitious Surter obtain their
wish and seat themselves on thrones.</p>
<p>But though the power of the infernal spirits was thus curbed,
it was not destroyed; and, still invincible in malice, they
resolved to wound Odin through his favourite, man.&nbsp; Lok gave
birth to the snaky sin, whose folds encircle the earth, and bade
him breathe from his poisonous jaws upon her surface the blast of
contention and hate: he obeyed; and man, no longer beneficent and
kind, rose up against his brother; with bitter words he poured
curses on the father who called him into <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>life, and
smote on the bosom that had nourished him in helplessness.&nbsp;
The father of evil beheld and smiled&mdash;his work was half
accomplished&mdash;and he called into existence death, to finish
the deeds begun: the pale shadow stalked over the earth and drank
the crimson blood till she grew wanton in her mirth, and besought
her father for a companion: he heard, and sent Fenris up to
follow her steps, and exult in her multiplied victims.&nbsp; The
fiends in hell heard the sounds of their triumph, and shouted
responsive, when the shivering spirits of the slain were hurled
weeping into Niftheim.&nbsp; At length their cruel joy was heard
in Asgard, at the same moment that sounds of sorrow ascended from
the earth, from the few who still remembered his name.&nbsp; It
was from Scythia the plaining voice arose, and the monarch,
looking down from his throne, beheld the last remnant of his
people sinking beneath the power of the Roman.&nbsp; Now then he
determined to descend to the earth, not only to lead them to
conquest, but teach them wisdom and virtue.&nbsp; Frea, the
mother of the gods, resolved to partake the toils of her husband;
and Thor, the eldest born of Odin, the ruler of the air, forsook
his palace of nine hundred and forty halls, laid by his terrific
thunderbolt, and his diadem of twelve stars, and, debasing his
giant frame to the standard of humanity, descended with his
father to the earth.&nbsp; Cased in the armour of Scythians, they
joined the troops of that beloved people, and the father god
bidding them contend no longer against the power of the Romans,
to whom Odin had given their country, promised to lead them to
other fields, and give them other lands for their
inheritance.&nbsp; The fierce Scythians yielded <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>to the
persuasive voice of him whom they only knew as the warrior Sigge,
and, rather than submit to the slavery they abhorred, they
forsook the tombs of their fathers, and sought an empire in the
north.</p>
<p>In vain the inhabitants of these regions sought to oppose the
establishment of the heaven-conducted Scythians; in every battle
they were defeated and driven with loss from their cities: the
arrows of Frea carried destruction to the enemy&mdash;the mallet
of Thor crushed thousands&mdash;and Odin, raging through their
ranks, now as a warrior, now as a ferocious lion, spread
devastation through their armies, and drove them from the
field.&nbsp; The Scythians saw these wonders, and secretly
acknowledged Valhalla&rsquo;s lord beneath the form of
Sigge.&nbsp; When the rage of battle was past, he lulled the
wounded to repose, and arrested the parting spirits of the dying
with the celestial strains of his harp; the wounds of his people
were cured, and their strength restored by his celestial power,
while, from the same cause, his enemies were bereft of courage
and of vigour.&nbsp; Sweden and Norway yielded to the matchless
warrior, and received with joy the unknown Sigge for their king,
but the Danes refused to acknowledge the leader of armies; and
Mimer, their prince, an enchanter, and the friend of Lok, opposed
himself against the victorious prince of Scythia.&nbsp; Before
the assembled Danes he contended with the stranger in eloquence
and poetry, and in these his own people were compelled, by the
severe laws of truth, to yield the palm to his rival.&nbsp; Mimer
was wise, eloquent, and brave; the strains of his harp were only
inferior to those of Sigge, and he felt deeply the injury which
he had sustained by the decision against him.&nbsp; Determined <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>to recover,
with his sword, the glory he had lost, he called his armies
together, and bade defiance to the Scythians: the opposing bands
drew near; furious was the contest, for now, like a tiger sprung
Mimer on his foes&mdash;now as a fiery serpent stung their
hearts, or crushed them in his mighty folds.&nbsp; As terrible
raged Odin in various forms, carrying dismay around him, and
thinning the ranks of the valiant Danes.&nbsp; At length the
monarchs met&mdash;in human form stood Mimer&mdash;in human form,
prepared to oppose him, stood Valhalla&rsquo;s mighty king: but
momentary was the contest, the terrible blow of the Scythian
brought the head of the Dane to his feet, as its faltering tongue
pronounced the name of Odin.&nbsp; The foe fled to the camp,
while the father of men again raised to life his beloved
Scythians who had fallen in this, the greatest of his
fields.&nbsp; At length, wishing to give peace to the weary land,
he summoned the Danish chiefs to meet him in conference.&nbsp;
Seated on a throne, he received the warriors: in one hand he held
the sceptre of his power, the other rested on a golden dish, in
which, now richly embalmed, and adorned with a crown of gold, lay
the head of the wretched Mimer.&nbsp; The chiefs gazed in
silence&mdash;a silence unbroken by human sounds, but disturbed
by the voice of the dead, for the ghastly head opened its closed
lips, fixed its eyes, and bade, in hollow but authoritative
tones, its countrymen no longer oppose the will of the gods, but
receive for their prince and lawgiver him who was master of the
world!&nbsp; Again it sunk into silence, and the astonished
Danes, obeying its dictates, fell at the feet of the conqueror of
Mimer.&nbsp; And now, seated in peace on the thrones of the
north, more <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>brightly shone the unmatched virtues of Sigge.&nbsp; He
taught his subjects husbandry&mdash;he taught them to plough the
waters&mdash;he opened to them the riches of commerce&mdash;and
he dug from the earth the treasures which ages had concealed in
her bosom;&mdash;he punished vice with severity&mdash;he rewarded
virtue with munificence&mdash;he taught them letters, instructed
them in the mysteries of the Runic&mdash;and obliged them to
cultivate the milder graces of music and verse;&mdash;he allured
men to obey by the charms of his eloquence and the splendour of
his glory; and he spoke to their reason by his divine Hovamaal,
which he gave them as his best gift&mdash;his richest
legacy.&nbsp; In this he bade them do no wrong to each
other&mdash;to honour the eternal gods&mdash;and to render up
life at the command of their country.&nbsp; When he beheld the
good effect of his regulations, and saw his people firmly
attached to his laws, he called around him his children, born of
his mortal wives, of the daughters of Scythia, and, dividing his
dominions among them, taught them to govern according to his
ordinances and example.&nbsp; Satisfied with his work, he called
Frea and Thor to his side, and, blessing once more his mortal
children, ascended with them into the regions of light.&nbsp;
Then loudly the Danes acknowledged Odin, and paid their homage to
his glory; to his race they have ever been faithful, for they
still fill the earthly thrones of their father, who, from his
abode in Asgard, looks down upon his children, and crowns their
lives with prosperity: and thus shall he do till the long night
which is to witness the last battle of the gods&mdash;the last
attack of Lok and his allies, and which for ages they have been
preparing&mdash;against Odin and the happy spirits of <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>Asgard.&nbsp; In the dreadful conflict, men and demons,
oceans, earths, Niftheim, nay, even Asgard itself, shall be
involved in one general wreck&mdash;one entire and
undistinguished ruin; the infernal spirits shall fall in the
convulsions&mdash;evil shall be no more&mdash;and from the ashes
of the universe shall arise a brighter heaven&mdash;a gloomier
hell, than those which have passed away.&nbsp; To the glorious
seats of Gimle, the city of burnished gold&mdash;to its
diamond-studded palaces and star-paved courts&mdash;shall the
spirits of the just ascend, with Odin and his triumphant sons, to
the enjoyment of one endless festival; while the cowards and
wicked of the earth shall sink with their infernal
allies&mdash;the revolted of heaven&mdash;into the caves of
Nastronde, an abode more horrible than Niftheim&mdash;a den built
up of the carcasses of snakes, and illuminated by devouring
flames, where ever-enduring sorrow shall be the punishment of the
lost, from which they shall have no power to escape, again to
disturb the repose of the just.</p>
<p>Honour and praise to Frea&mdash;victory to Thor&mdash;glory to
Odin, the greatest, and the best&mdash;hail to the master of gods
and men!</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Happily for his hearers, it was here, at length, that the
merciless Brandomann terminated his long-winded history.&nbsp;
Sleipner had for some time been his only auditor&mdash;Ildegarda
had been nodding repeatedly&mdash;Heidruna fidgetily trotting
backwards and forwards to the portal, watching the
clouds&mdash;Serimnor had given two or three most portentous
yawns&mdash;while the two ravens <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>who did every thing in concert, had
tucked their heads under their wings, and gone fairly to
sleep:&mdash;but they all started up when the hum of his voice
had ceased, and thanked the good Brandomann as sincerely as if
they had been excessively delighted, for they were grateful that
he had finished at last, and were besides too well bred not to be
charmed with what had been done entirely for their amusement.</p>
<p>On the following day, during their usual rambles about the
island, the princess looked so unusually depressed, and said so
little in reply to the observations of her companion, that his
attention, ever on the watch, was aroused by her sadness;
tenderly he inquired the cause.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell
you,&rdquo; replied Ildegarda: &ldquo;when absent from you, and
believing your life in danger, my only anxiety was to return;
now, when that difficulty has passed away, I confess I am
wretched respecting my father&rsquo;s feelings and conduct, when
he shall discover that I have quitted him for ever; neither is my
heart without a pang when I reflect that I shall see him no
more.&nbsp; Oh that I knew what is to come!&mdash;that I could
look into the future, and behold my destiny and his!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know not that it is in my power altogether to fulfil
your wishes,&rdquo; answered Brandomann; &ldquo;but I can give
you a glance into the future, so as to discover its general
complexion, but not to enable you to read exactly the very page
of destiny.&nbsp; That which I can, to gratify your curiosity, I
will do,&mdash;I will arrest for a few minutes the flight of the
triune deity Time, and, by her appearance, we shall be able to
judge of what is to come.&mdash;Urda, Werandi, Skulda!&rdquo;
continued Brandomann, raising his powerful voice to its utmost <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>pitch,
&ldquo;obey the command of the lord of the Maelstrom, the mighty
delegate of Odin&mdash;pause in your flight for a moment, and
stand visibly before him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Scarcely was the
peremptory order uttered, ere a light cloud was seen advancing
towards them from the sea, and when it became stationary
Ildegarda beheld a female form slowly and gracefully emerging
from its centre; her features were indistinctly visible, and upon
the floating misty robe that enveloped her figure, many changing
objects were, some faintly, some powerfully, represented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is Urda the Past,&rdquo; said Brandomann to Ildegarda;
&ldquo;the events written upon her breast and brow are partially
concealed in her garment of oblivion and doubt; and when this is
penetrated by mortal sight, they are still seen through the mists
of passion and prejudice, by which she is ever surrounded: look
now upon her breast and brow&mdash;what objects do they represent
to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see a criminal,&rdquo; said the
princess, &ldquo;about to suffer the sentence of
justice&mdash;the executioner is preparing to
strike.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To my view the representation is
different,&rdquo; replied Brandomann; &ldquo;I see a crowned king
falling beneath the murderous swords of his rebellious
subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I observe a dying parent,&rdquo;
continued Ildegarda, &ldquo;who consigns his child to a noble
warrior who weeps by his couch, but presses the babe to his
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I also see the dying father,&rdquo;
said Brandomann, &ldquo;but he resigns his infant to a demon in
form, and worse than a demon in heart, for he instantly plunges a
dagger in its throat: what else do you remark?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Many other objects,&rdquo; continued the princess,
&ldquo;but nothing clearly; the goddess herself is retiring
slowly from my gaze, and to whom does <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>she give place?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To Werandi the Present,&rdquo; answered Brandomann,
&ldquo;in snow-white robe, with her unveiled face and open brow
and eye&mdash;how clear she looks upon us!&mdash;and her garments
will shew us our actions of this moment:&mdash;but she retires,
and Skulda the Future supplies her place; clad in a robe of
darkness, she exhibits nothing to our eyes, and the veil which
covers her person conceals also her face from our observation:
she shall withdraw it, and her smile or frown will shadow forth
your destiny.&rdquo;&nbsp; The goddess gently withdrew her veil,
and the soft enchanting smile which she beamed upon the princess
banished anxiety from her bosom, and graced the departure of the
triune spirit with the sweet attribute of benevolence.</p>
<p>A few days after the prophetic smile of the deity of Time had
given such hope to the heart of Ildegarda, they were wandering
about the gardens of the palace, astonished by the roaring of
thunders which announced a distant storm: they were surprised by
the sudden change from daylight to darkness, and were puzzling
each other respecting its cause, when the storm died rapidly
away, the clouds fell down in a gentle shower, and the rainbow
bridge stood out in faint splendour from the heavens.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look, dearest,&rdquo; said Brandomann; &ldquo;the spirit
of the bow has lowered his beautiful bridge&mdash;some of the
lesser warriors are ascending to Valhalla&mdash;I will address
the guardian of it, and bid him render the road and its
passengers visible to your sight.&mdash;All hail Heimdaller of
the coloured crown!&rdquo; continued Brandomann, &ldquo;the
friend of Odin speaks to thee; beautiful spirit of the rushing
wings and eyes of tender glory, let us look upon thy face, <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>and the
road which leads to thy dwelling!&rdquo;&nbsp; The silvery voice
of the spirit answered him, giving an immediate assent to his
desire, and in a moment the road and its travellers became
visible to Ildegarda.&nbsp; Slowly, and with feeble steps, the
wounded warriors dragged themselves on till they reached the
summit of the bridge, when the gates of light flew open, and the
spirit, in giving them his hand bestowed upon them strength and
beauty, and thus prepared them for the presence of Odin and the
glories of the Valhalla.</p>
<p>While Ildegarda with intense interest was watching the solemn
procession of the dead, her eyes were suddenly dazzled by a
brilliant light thrown upon the bridge, which now shone out in
tenfold splendour, colouring the mountains of the island with
tints of its beautiful hues.&nbsp; She looked up, and beheld the
spirit of the bow descending, glorious in his youthful beauty;
his diadem of many-coloured gems was on his lofty brow, and, in
the ineffable loveliness of his sunny smile, there was a
sweetness that made Ildegarda weep.&nbsp; &ldquo;He goes to
welcome one of the greatest of mortal heroes,&rdquo; said
Brandomann&mdash;&ldquo;one of the favourites of Odin; his
presence throws this glory round him, and at this moment the
beings of earth, who gaze upon the bridge, behold its colours at
the brightest: but see&mdash;at the foot of the arch there is one
ascending to meet the spirit!&mdash;his wounds are
terrible&mdash;his bosom is fearfully gored&mdash;and his steps
are feeble and slow&mdash;but he has the brow and the port of a
hero; as yet I know him not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But <i>I</i>
do!&rdquo; shrieked the hapless Ildegarda&mdash;&ldquo;O
Brandomann, I know him well!&rdquo;&nbsp; The lord of the
Maelstrom looked up again, and painfully recognised the
shadow&mdash;it <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>was indeed her father;&mdash;the pale inhabitant of
another world, whom she saw ascending slowly to meet the welcome
smile of the angel of light, was once the noble Haquin, the last
friend of Harold and his sons.&nbsp; Brandomann gazed in grief
and terror, and the sorrow he felt for the death of the warrior
was scarcely mitigated by the change wrought in his wearied frame
by the touch of the radiant Heimdaller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ildegarda!&rdquo; he cried in a voice of tenderness and
pity; &ldquo;Ildegarda, think not that thou art alone in the
world, or that all that loved thee have left it; look up, my dear
one!&mdash;look on the happiness of thy noble father, and cease
to regret his fate; what could thy love offer him in exchange for
this?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda mournfully assented as she saw his
glory, and her grief became more resigned and gentle.&nbsp; She
returned to the palace with Brandomann, who, far from attempting
to console, wept with her the loss she had sustained.&nbsp; In
the evening her friends did not as usual visit the island, but
they explained the cause of their absence on the next.&nbsp; It
was in honour of Haquin they had been detained at Valhalla, as
Odin had commanded the feast earlier, in order to compliment this
noble warrior,&mdash;&ldquo;who now,&rdquo; continued Sleipner,
&ldquo;sits highest in the hall, and nearest to Odin&rsquo;s
self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time reconciled the princess to her father&rsquo;s death, and
to her hopeless imprisonment in Moskoe.&nbsp; The generous
Brandomann, now that she had lost in the world all that was dear
to her, and was most entirely in his power, never spoke to her of
the love which it was but too plain he bore her.&nbsp; She saw
and rewarded his virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brandomann!&rdquo; she said to him one day as they
wandered through the gardens of the desolate <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>isle;
&ldquo;Brandomann, friend of my heart, in the world, where my
father walks no longer, I have no interest, and can never wish to
return; yet I feel that I could love and render some deserving
being more happy than a lonely destiny could make him; thou alone
art worthy of this heart, and of the duty which I will pay thee;
I cannot love thee as I once loved Haldane&mdash;as I fear I
should love him still&mdash;that feeling it is not in thy power
to inspire; but I honour thy virtue, and am grateful for its
exercise.&nbsp; Wilt thou accept this hand&mdash;this
heart?&nbsp; If so, take me, Brandomann, for I am
thine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw herself as she spoke, into the arms which opened
transportedly to receive her, and bowed her head upon his
breast.&nbsp; She could not distinguish his reply, for a sudden
peal of thunder rolled above their heads, and the earth was
shaken to its foundation&mdash;a frightful darkness covered the
island, and shrieks and howlings rung in their ears, mingled with
shouts of triumph and the cheering blasts of the trumpet.&nbsp;
Ildegarda clung closer to her lover for protection, when a
gentle, well-known voice reassured her spirits and relieved her
terrors.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look on me, my beloved,&rdquo; it said;
&ldquo;look on me, and receive the reward of thy virtue, and the
approbation of Heaven on thy choice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess
raised her eyes to the face of her lover, and beheld&mdash;not
Brandomann, but Haldane&mdash;the one, the only beloved, the
first choice of her innocent heart; it was on his bosom she
leaned&mdash;it was his arm that supported her slender form: she
trembled with painful emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
Brandomann?&rdquo; she demanded&mdash;&ldquo;Is at thy feet, my
beloved,&rdquo; replied the graceful warrior: &ldquo;beneath that
hideous form, Lok, in revenge for <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>an ancient scorn, had condemned me
to wear out my life, unless I could inspire a royal virgin with
sufficient love to become my wife.&nbsp; Odin, in compassion to
my sufferings, confined me to this island, and endowed me with
sufficient power to fulfil the condition, and deceive and baffle
the evil spirits themselves, by the means of their wretched
agent, the detestable Frotho.&nbsp; Around thee stand the gallant
chiefs and the Norwegian captives, who were sent against the
monster of the Maelstrom, and who seemed to be destroyed by my
vengeance; they are now my friends, and wait to conduct us to
Denmark, where Haldane will lay his crown at thy
feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chiefs paid their homage to the princess,
and immediately after, there arrived, to offer their sincere
congratulations, her tender friends of many moons, the
eight-legged, four-legged, and two-legged animals of
Valhalla.&nbsp; Ildegarda, even on the bosom of Haldane, wept at
the parting; for she knew she should behold them no more.&nbsp;
They attended her to the shore, and beheld her embark in the
gallant ship which Niord, at the command of Odin, had preserved
for them in one of the ocean caves.&nbsp; Soon they were wafted
to Denmark, and Haldane burst upon the usurper so suddenly, that
he had no time even to arm his household guards for his
defence.&nbsp; He was presiding at a festival when Haldane
entered his presence; some of his nobles humbly acknowledged
their prince, and the others, not caring to attack him, made the
best of their way out of the palace, leaving the miserable Frotho
in the power of his nephew, who, without giving him time to make
his will, threw him headlong into the cistern of mead before
which he was sitting.</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>Whether Haldane, in his natural shape, was as amiable
and complaisant as he had been under his assumed one, is a
question which the historian of his life cannot answer&mdash;nor
whether Ildegarda, on her throne in Denmark, found as true
friends and faithful servants as she had in the gulf of the
Maelstrom: certain it is, she lived to a great age with her
glorious husband, (who was the greatest prince of the race of Dan
that ever swayed the sceptre of the north,) and that once or
twice during their lives they had together visited the desolate
isle; and the princess, to the great scandal of the ladies and
gentlemen of the court, and surprise of her husband, wept
bitterly on finding that the marble palace and its beautiful
gardens had disappeared, the Moskoe isle had resumed its ancient
appearance, and nothing remained to mark it out as the scene of
such wonders as had passed in it.&nbsp; It has much the same
character at this hour; and it would be very difficult to
persuade its inhabitants, or the stranger who may visit its
shores, that it once was a paradise only second to the bowers of
Valasciolf&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; You, gentle reader, know better;
and complimenting you on the patience by which you have acquired
this knowledge, I bid you, for the present, farewell.</p>

264</span>NOTES<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THE</span><br />
LORD OF THE MAELSTROM.</h3>
<h4>PART I.</h4>
<p><i>Olave the Second</i>&mdash;one of the early kings of
Denmark, of the race of Dan.&nbsp; These princes believed
themselves descended from Odin.&nbsp; Olave was a worthless,
profligate prince, who left two sons, who succeeded him; the
elder, Frotho the Fifth, murdered his brother Harold, and
afterwards the assassin who, by his own order, had stabbed
him.&nbsp; He endeavoured to secure the persons of the princes
his nephews; but a nobleman, friend to their father, conveyed
them out of his reach, and concealed them in a cave till they
were of an age to revenge these injuries.</p>
<p><i>Asgard</i>&mdash;the country of the gods; the Olympus of
the north.</p>
<p>Valasciolf&mdash;its chief city, in which the principal
divinities and more illustrious dead resided in magnificent
palaces.</p>
<p><i>Valhalla</i>&mdash;the chief palace of Valasciolf, the
regal residence of Odin.</p>
<p><i>Niftheim</i>&mdash;Hell.&nbsp; A territory of devouring
flames typifying eternal remorse; the abode of the evil principle
and his attendant spirits.</p>
<p><i>Feggo</i>&mdash;the brother of Harwendil, king of Jutland,
and uncle to Hamlet.&nbsp; The latter prince feigned madness
after the murder of his father, but killed Feggo at a
festival.&nbsp; He succeeded to the crown, which he wore with
honour till killed in battle by Viglet, king of Denmark.</p>
<p><i>Lok</i>&mdash;the evil principle.&nbsp; He gave birth to
Midgard (sin), the snake whose folds encircle the
earth&mdash;Hela (death)&mdash;and the wolf Fenris, the guardian
of the gate of hell; these were the evil progeny of Lok, begotten
for the destruction of the human race.</p>
<p><i>Surter</i>&mdash;the evil divinity of fire&mdash;the next
in rank to Lok.&nbsp; The Scythians represented him as a
beautiful youth; the Saxons as an old man, to whose honour they
dedicated the seventh day of the week.</p>
<p><i>Balder</i>&mdash;son of Odin, god of eloquence and poetry,
and ruler of the sun&mdash;the Scandinavian Apollo.&nbsp; He was
represented <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>as a youth with a burning wheel upon his breast; his
face resembled the sun.</p>
<p><i>Nastronde</i>&mdash;According to the Scandinavian
mythology, at the end of the world, during a night which was to
last a year, a tremendous battle was to be fought between the
good and evil spirits, in which the former were to conquer and
reign in Gimle, a more glorious heaven than Asgard; while the
wicked were to be banished to Nastronde, a new hell, made
purposely for them.</p>
<h4>PART II.</h4>
<p><i>Maelstrom</i>, <i>Malestrom</i>, or
<i>Moskoestrom</i>&mdash;a tremendous whirlpool on the Norwegian
coast, very dangerous, and often fatal to navigators venturing
too near it.&nbsp; Moskoe is an island situated in the gulf:
there are also several others.</p>
<p><i>Sleipner</i>&mdash;the warrior horse of Odin.&nbsp; He had
four black legs and four white ones: he generally travelled
through the air.</p>
<p><i>Rinda</i>&mdash;daughter of Balder, and mother of Vile, by
Odin.&nbsp; The favourite goddess of the Scandinavian women.</p>
<p><i>Hydrasil</i>&mdash;the tree of heaven, standing in the
garden of Odin.&nbsp; It was the abode of the disposer of
man&rsquo;s destiny.</p>
<h4>PART III.</h4>
<p><i>Heidruna</i>&mdash;the immortal goat, whose milk was the
hydromel served up nightly at the festivals of Valhalla.</p>
<p><i>Serimnor</i>&mdash;the wild boar, whose flesh served them
for food.</p>
<p><i>Hugo</i> and <i>Mumin</i>&mdash;the raven messengers of
Odin.</p>
<p><i>Thor</i>&mdash;the warrior god&mdash;the eldest son of
Odin, who, in his journey over the world, defeated Midgard, and
loosened his folds from the earth; he is typical of divine
justice and vengeance.&nbsp; In the beautiful fables of the
Scalds, he is represented as a stern warrior, armed with an
enormous mallet, and wearing a crown of twelve stars.&nbsp; He
lived in a palace of Valasciolf, of five hundred and forty halls,
and was the ruler and wielder of the thunderbolt.</p>
<p><i>Forsete</i>&mdash;divinity of controversy.&nbsp; I believe
this deity is peculiar to the Scandinavians.&nbsp; He lived in a
palace called Glitner.</p>
<p><i>Blind horror</i>&mdash;Hoder&mdash;whose name was never
pronounced by the Scythians without fear and immediate
expiation&mdash;son of Odin, and born blind&mdash;the deity of
strength.&nbsp; He was abhorred in heaven, because, from envy, he
attacked Balder, threw him from his throne, and put out the
sun.&nbsp; Odin interfered, and punished Hoder by the arrows of
Vile (lightning), and afterwards restored the sun.&nbsp; It was
thus, in their beautiful and fanciful mythology, like the Greeks,
and I think no <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>less elegantly, that the Scalds described natural, but
not understood events.&nbsp; This story describes an eclipse of
the sun, the strong and blind Hoder signifying darkness.</p>
<p><i>Lofna</i>&mdash;goddess of reconciliation.&nbsp; I believe
this deity is also peculiar to the Scythians; they have deified
her with great propriety.&nbsp; Her post could not have been a
sinecure in a paradise where happiness consisted in drinking and
fighting.</p>
<p><i>Hiarn</i>&mdash;his story is strictly historical.&nbsp; It
was Eric the Third who was so maddened by music as to commit
murder for no other cause.</p>
<p><i>Geysers</i>&mdash;boiling spouting springs in Iceland: they
are near to Skalholt and Hecla; they spout water to a tremendous
and incredible height.</p>
<p><i>Dofrefeld</i>&mdash;a mighty range of Norwegian mountains,
intersected by rivers and cataracts.</p>
<p><i>Dolsteen</i>&mdash;a wonderful cavern beneath the Dofrefeld
mountains.</p>
<p><i>Niord</i>&mdash;the Scandinavian Neptune.</p>
<h4>PART IV.</h4>
<p><i>Uffon</i>&mdash;this story is also historical.&nbsp;
Shakspeare, who read Danish history, borrowed the circumstance of
Vermund&rsquo;s death for that of Gloster in King Lear.</p>
<p><i>Lidscialf</i>&mdash;the throne of Odin.</p>
<p><i>Heimdaller</i>&mdash;guardian of the bridge Bifrost, or the
rainbow, by which the happy dead ascended into Asgard.&nbsp; He
received the souls who were selected by the Valkyries, and
conducted them to Odin.</p>
<p><i>Vile</i>&mdash;god of archery; son of Odin and Rinda.</p>
<h4>PART V.</h4>
<p><i>Brage</i>&mdash;god of music and song.</p>
<p><i>Hovamaal</i>&mdash;bible of Odin.</p>
<p><i>Odin</i>&mdash;a wise and virtuous warrior, whose
beneficence procured him among the early Scythians,
deification.&nbsp; As a divinity, the father of gods and men, he
is the husband of Frea (the earth), and from the union of divine
love and the earth, spring light, heat, the elements, the
seasons, strength, and genius, typified by Balder, Thor, Frey,
Hoder, and Balder again, as orator and poet.&nbsp; Odin, mounted
upon his horse Sleipner, represents active benevolence.</p>

SPECTRE BARBER.</h2>
<blockquote><p>Sir Ryence of North Gales greeteth well thee,<br

And bids thy beard anon to him send,<br />
Or else from thy jaws he will it off

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> formerly lived at Bremen, a
wealthy merchant named Melchior, of whom it was remarked that he
invariably stroked his chin with complacency whenever the subject
of the sermon was the rich man in the Gospel; who, by-the-bye, in
comparison with him, was only a petty retail dealer.&nbsp; This
said Melchior possessed such great riches, that he had caused the
floor of his dining-room to be paved with crown-pieces, which
ridiculous luxury gave great offence to his fellow-citizens and
relations.&nbsp; They attributed it to vanity and ostentation,
but did not guess its true motive; however, it perfectly answered
the end Melchior designed by it; for, by their constantly
expressing their disapprobation of this ostentatious species of
vanity, they spread abroad the report of their neighbour&rsquo;s
immense riches, and thereby augmented his credit in a most
astonishing degree.</p>
<p>At length Melchior died suddenly, while at a corporation
dinner, and consequently had not time to make a disposition of
his property by will; so that his only son Francis, who was just
of age, came into possession of the whole.&nbsp; This young man
was particularly favoured by fortune, <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>both with respect to his personal
advantages and his goodness of heart; but his immense inheritance
caused his ruin.&nbsp; He had no sooner got into the possession
of so considerable a fortune, than he squandered it, as if it had
been a burthen to him; ran into every possible extravagance, and
neglected his concerns.&nbsp; Two or three years passed over
without his perceiving that, owing to his dissipations, his funds
were considerably reduced; but at length his coffers were
emptied: and one day, when Francis had drawn a draft to a very
considerable amount on his banker, who had no funds to meet it,
it was returned to him protested.&nbsp; This disappointment
greatly vexed our prodigal, but only as it caused a temporary
check to his wishes; for he did not even then give himself the
trouble to inquire into the reason of it.&nbsp; After swearing
and blustering for some time, he gave his steward a positive but
laconic order to <i>get money</i>.</p>
<p>All the brokers, money-changers, and usurers, were put in
requisition, and the empty coffers were soon filled; for the
dining-room floor was in the eyes of the lenders a sufficient
security.</p>
<p>This paliative had its effect for a time; but all at once a
report was spread abroad in the city that the celebrated silver
floor had been taken up: the consequence of which was, that the
lenders insisted on examining into and proving the fact, and then
became urgent for payment; but as Francis had not the means to
meet their demands, they seized on all his goods and chattels;
every thing was sold by auction, and he had nothing left
excepting a few jewels, which had formed part of his heritage,
and which might for a short time keep him from starving.</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>He
now took up his abode in a small street in one of the most remote
quarters of the city, where he lived on his straitened
means.&nbsp; He, however, accommodated himself to his situation;
but the only resource that he found against the <i>ennui</i>
which overpowered him was to play on the lute; and when fatigued
by this exercise, he used to stand at his window and make
observations on the weather; and his intelligent mind was not
long in discovering an object which soon entirely engrossed all
his thoughts.</p>
<p>Opposite his window there lived a respectable woman, who was
at her spinning wheel from morning till night, and by her
industry earned a subsistence for herself and her daughter.&nbsp;
Meta was a young girl of great beauty and attraction: she had
known happier times: for her father had been the proprietor of a
vessel freighted by himself, in which he annually made trading
voyages to Antwerp; but he, as well as the ship and all its
cargo, was lost in a violent storm.&nbsp; His widow sustained
this double loss with resignation and firmness, and resolved to
support herself and her daughter by her own industry.&nbsp; She
made over the house and furniture to the creditors of her
husband, and took up her abode in the little bye street where
Francis lodged, where, by her assiduity she acquired a
subsistence without laying herself under an obligation to any
one.&nbsp; She brought up her daughter to spinning and other
works, and lived with so much economy, that by her savings she
was enabled to set up a little trade in linen.</p>
<p>Mother Bridget (which was the appellation given to our widow,)
did not, however, calculate on terminating her existence in this
penurious <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>situation; and the hope of better prospects sustained
her courage.&nbsp; The beauty and excellent qualities of her
daughter, whom she brought up with every possible care and
attention, led her to think that some advantageous offer would
one day present itself.&nbsp; Meta lived tranquilly and lonely
with her mother, was never seen in any of the public walks, and
indeed never went out but to mass once a day.</p>
<p>One day, while Francis was making his metrological
observations at the window, he saw the beautiful Meta, who, under
her mother&rsquo;s watchful eye, was returning from church.&nbsp;
The heart of Francis was as yet quite free: for the boisterous
pleasures of his past life did not leave him leisure for a true
affection; but at this time, when all his senses were calm, the
appearance of one of the most enchanting female forms he had ever
seen, ravished him, and he henceforth thought solely of the
adorable object which his eyes had thus discovered.&nbsp; He
questioned his landlord respecting the two females who lived in
the opposite house, and from him learned the particulars we have
just related.</p>
<p>He now regretted his want of economy, since his present
miserable state prevented him from making an offer to the
charming Meta.&nbsp; He was, however, constantly at the window,
in hopes of seeing her; and in that consisted his greatest
delight.&nbsp; The mother very soon discovered the frequent
appearance of her new neighbour at his window, and attributed it
to its right cause.&nbsp; In consequence, she rigorously enjoined
her daughter not to show herself at the windows, which were now
kept constantly shut.</p>
<p>Francis was not much versed in the arts of <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>finesse,
but love awakened all the energies of his soul.&nbsp; He soon
discovered that if he appeared much at the window, his views
would be suspected; and he resolved therefore studiously to
refrain from coming near it.&nbsp; He determined, however, to
continue his observation of what occurred in the opposite
dwelling without being perceived.&nbsp; He accordingly purchased
a large mirror, and fixed it in his chamber in such a position
that it distinctly presented to his view what passed in the abode
of his opposite neighbour.&nbsp; Francis not being seen at the
window, the old lady relaxed in her rigour, and Meta&rsquo;s
windows were once more opened.&nbsp; Love, more than ever,
reigned triumphant in the bosom of Francis; but how was he to
make known his attachment to its object? he could neither speak
nor write to her.&nbsp; Love, however, soon suggested a mode of
communication which succeeded.&nbsp; Our prodigal took his lute,
and drew from it tones the best adapted to express the subject of
his passion: and by perseverance, in less than a month he made a
wonderful progress.&nbsp; He soon had the gratification of seeing
the fair hand of Meta open the little casement, when he began to
tune his instrument.&nbsp; When she made her appearance, he
testified his joy by an air lively and gay; but if she did not
show herself, the melancholy softness of his tones discovered the
disappointment he experienced.</p>
<p>In the course of a short time, he created a great interest in
the bosom of his fair neighbour; and soon had reason to be
convinced that Meta shared a mutual attachment.&nbsp; She now
endeavoured to justify him, when her mother with acrimony spoke
of his prodigality and past misconduct, by attributing his ruin
to the effect of bad example.&nbsp; <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>But in so doing, she cautiously
avoided exciting the suspicions of the old lady; and seemed less
anxious to excuse him, than to take a part in the conversation
that was going on.</p>
<p>Circumstances, which our limits will not allow us to relate,
rendered the situation of Francis more and more difficult to be
supported; his funds had now nearly failed him; and an offer of
marriage from a wealthy brewer, who was called in the
neighbourhood the &ldquo;King of Hops,&rdquo; but which Meta,
much to her mother&rsquo;s disappointment, refused, excited still
more the apprehensions of poor Francis, lest some more fortunate
suitor might yet be received and blast his hopes for ever.</p>
<p>When he received the information that this opulent lover had
been rejected for his sake, with what bitterness did he lament
his past follies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generous girl,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you sacrifice
yourself for a miserable creature, who has nothing but a heart
fondly attached to you, and which is riven with despair that its
possessor cannot offer you the happiness you so truly
merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King of Hops soon found another female, who listened more
kindly to his vows, and whom he wedded with great splendour.</p>
<p>Love, however, did not leave his work incomplete; for its
influence created in the mind of Francis a desire of exerting his
faculties and actively employing himself, in order, if possible,
to emerge from the state of nothingness into which he was at
present plunged; and it inspired him also with courage to
prosecute his good intention.&nbsp; Among various projects which
he formed, the most rational appeared that of overlooking his
father&rsquo;s books, taking an account of the claimable <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>debts, and
from that source to get all he possibly could.&nbsp; The produce
of this procedure would, he thought, furnish him with the means
of beginning in some small way of business; and his imagination
led him to extend this to the most remote corners of the
earth.&nbsp; In order to equip himself for the prosecution of his
plans, he sold all the remainder of his father&rsquo;s effects,
and with the money purchased a horse to begin his travels.</p>
<p>The idea of a separation from Meta was almost more than he
could endure.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will she think,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;of this sudden disappearance, when she no longer meets me
in her way to church?&nbsp; Will she not think me perfidious, and
banish me from her heart?&rdquo;&nbsp; Such ideas as these caused
him infinite pain; and for a long while he could not devise any
means of acquainting Meta with his plans; but at length the
fertile genius of love furnished him with the following
idea:&mdash;Francis went to the curate of the church which his
mistress daily frequented, and requested him, before the sermon
and during mass, to put up prayers for a happy issue to the
affairs of a young traveller; and these prayers were to be
continued till the moment of his return, when they were to be
changed into those of thanks.</p>
<p>Every thing being arranged for his departure, he mounted his
steed, and passed close under Meta&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; He
saluted her with a very significant air, and with much less
caution than heretofore.&nbsp; The young girl blushed deeply; and
mother Bridget took this opportunity of loudly expressing her
dislike to this bold adventurer, whose impertinence and foppery
induced him to form designs on her daughter.</p>
<p>From this period the eyes of Meta in vain <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>searched
for Francis.&nbsp; She constantly heard the prayer which was put
up for him; but was so entirely absorbed by grief at no longer
perceiving the object of her affection, that she paid no
attention to the words of the priest.&nbsp; In no way could she
account for his disappearing.&nbsp; Some months afterwards, her
grief being somewhat ameliorated and her mind more tranquillized,
when she was one day thinking of the last time she had seen
Francis, the prayer arrested her attention; she reflected for an
instant, and quickly divined for whom it was said; she naturally
joined in it with great fervour, and strongly recommended the
young traveller to the protection of her guardian angel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Francis continued his journey, and had travelled the
whole of a very sultry day, over one of the desert cantons of
Westphalia without meeting with a single house.&nbsp; As night
approached, a violent storm came on: the rain fell in torrents;
and poor Francis was soaked to the very skin.&nbsp; In this
miserable situation he anxiously looked around, and fortunately
discovered in the distance a light, towards which he directed his
horse&rsquo;s steps; but as he drew near, he beheld a miserable
cottage, which did not promise him much succour, for it more
resembled a stable than the habitation of a human being.&nbsp;
The unfeeling wretch who inhabited it, refused him fire or water,
as if he had been a banished man&mdash;he was just about to
extend himself on the straw in the midst of the cattle, and his
indolence prevented his lighting a fire for the stranger.&nbsp;
Francis vainly endeavoured to move the peasant to pity: the
latter was inexorable, and blew out his candle with the greatest
nonchalance possible, without bestowing a thought on
Francis.&nbsp; However, as the <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>traveller hindered him from
sleeping, by his incessant lamentations and prayers, he was
anxious to get rid of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said he to him, &ldquo;if you wish to be
accommodated, I promise you it will not be here; but ride through
the little wood to your left hand, and you will find the castle
belonging to the chevalier Eberhard Bronkhorst, who is very
hospitable to travellers; but he has a singular mania, which is,
to flagellate all whom he entertains: therefore decide
accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis, after considering for some minutes, resolved on
hazarding the adventure.&nbsp; &ldquo;In good faith,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;there is no great difference between having
one&rsquo;s back broken by the miserable accommodation of a
peasant, or by the chevalier Bronkhorst: friction disperses
fever; possibly its effects may prove beneficial to me, if I am
compelled to keep on my wet garments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly he put spurs to his horse, and very shortly found
himself before a gothic castle, at the iron gate of which he
loudly knocked, and was answered from within
by&mdash;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;&nbsp; But ere he was
allowed time to reply, the gate was opened.&nbsp; However, in the
first court he was compelled to wait with patience, till they
could learn whether it was the lord of the castle&rsquo;s
pleasure to flagellate a traveller, or send him out to pass the
night under the canopy of heaven.</p>
<p>The lord of the castle had from his earliest infancy served in
the Imperial army, under the command of George of Funsberg, and
had himself led a company of infantry against the
Venetians.&nbsp; At length, however, fatigued with warfare, he
had retired to his own territory, where, in order to expiate the
crimes he had committed during the <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>several campaigns he had been in, he
did all the good and charitable acts in his power.&nbsp; But his
manner still retained all the roughness of his former
profession.&nbsp; The newly-arrived guest, although disposed to
submit to the usages of the house, for the sake of the good fare,
could not help feeling a certain trembling of fear as he heard
the bolts grating, ere the doors were opened to him; and which,
by their groaning noise, seemed to presage the catastrophe which
awaited him.&nbsp; A cold perspiration came over him as he passed
the last door; but finding that he received the utmost attention,
his fears a little abated.&nbsp; The servants assisted him in
getting off his horse, and unfastened his cloak-bag; some of them
led his horse to the stable, whilst others preceding him with
flambeaux, conducted him to their master, who awaited his arrival
in a room magnificently lighted up.</p>
<p>Poor Francis was seized with a universal tremor, when he
beheld the martial air and athletic form of the lord of the
castle, who came up to him and shook him by the hand with so much
force as nearly to make him cry out, and in a thundering voice,
enough to stun him, told him he was welcome.&nbsp; Francis
trembled like an aspen leaf in every part of his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, my young comrade?&rdquo; cried the
chevalier Bronkhorst; &ldquo;what makes you thus tremble, and
render you as pale as if death had actually seized you in the
throat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis recovered himself; and knowing that his shoulders
would pay his reckoning, his fears gave place to a species of
audacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered he with confidence, &ldquo;you
see that I am so soaked with rain that one might suppose I had
swam through the Wezer; order <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>me therefore some dry clothes
instead of these I have on, and let us then drink a cup of hot
wine, that I may, if possible, prevent the fever, which otherwise
may probably seize me.&nbsp; It will comfort my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admirable!&rdquo; replied the chevalier; &ldquo;ask for
whatever you want, and consider yourself here as at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly Francis gave his orders like a baron of high
degree: he sent away the wet clothes, made choice of others, and,
in fine, made himself quite at his ease.&nbsp; The chevalier, so
far from expressing any dissatisfaction at his free and easy
manners, commanded his people to execute whatever he ordered with
promptitude, and condemned some of them as blockheads, who did
not appear to know how to wait on a stranger.&nbsp; As soon as
the table was spread, the chevalier seated himself at it with his
guest; and they drank a cup of hot wine together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish for any thing to eat?&rdquo; demanded the
lord.</p>
<p>Francis desired he would order up what his house afforded,
that he might see whether his kitchen was good.</p>
<p>No sooner had he said this, than the steward made his
appearance, and furnished up a most delicious repast, Francis did
not wait for his being requested to partake of it: but after
having made a hearty meal, he said to the lord of the castle,
&ldquo;Your kitchen is by no means despicable; if your cellar is
correspondent, I cannot but say you treat your guests
nobly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chevalier made a sign to his butler, who brought up some
inferior wine, and filled a large <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>glass to his master, who drank to
his guest.&nbsp; Francis instantly returned the compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young man, what say you to my wine?&rdquo; asked
the chevalier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Faith,&rdquo; replied Francis, &ldquo;I say it
is bad, if it is the best you have in your cellar; but if you
have none worse, I do not condemn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a connoisseur;&rdquo; answered the
chevalier.&nbsp; &ldquo;Butler, bring us a flask of older
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His orders being instantly attended to, Francis tasted
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is indeed some good old wine, and we will
stick to it if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servants brought in a great pitcher of it, and the
chevalier, being in high good-humour, drank freely with his
guest; and then launched out into a long history of his several
feats of prowess in the war against the Venetians.&nbsp; He
became so overheated by the recital, that in his enthusiasm he
overturned the bottles and glasses, and flourishing his knife as
if it were a sword, passed it so near the nose and ears of
Francis, that he dreaded he should lose them in the action.</p>
<p>Though the night wore away, the chevalier did not manifest any
desire to sleep; for he was quite in his elements, whenever he
got on the topic of the Venetian war.&nbsp; Each succeeding glass
added to the heat of his imagination as he proceeded in his
narration, till at length Francis began to apprehend that it was
the prologue to the tragedy in which he was to play the principal
part; and feeling anxious to learn whether he was to pass the
night in the castle, or be turned out, he asked for a last glass
of wine to enable him to sleep well.&nbsp; He feared that they
would commence by filling him with wine, and that if he did not
consent to continue drinking, a pretext would be laid hold <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>of for
driving him out of the castle with the usual chastisement.</p>
<p>However, contrary to his expectation, the lord of the castle
broke the thread of his narration, and said to
him:&mdash;&ldquo;Good friend, every thing in its place;
to-morrow we will resume our discourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir knight,&rdquo; replied Francis;
&ldquo;to-morrow, before sun-rise, I shall be on my road.&nbsp;
The distance from hence to Brabant is very considerable, and I
cannot tarry here longer, therefore permit me to take leave of
you now, that I may not disturb you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you please about that; but you will not leave
the castle before I am up; we will breakfast together, and I
shall accompany you to the outer gate, and take leave of you
according to my usual custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis needed no comment to render these words
intelligible.&nbsp; Most willingly would he have dispensed with
the chevalier&rsquo;s company to the gate; but the latter did not
appear at all inclined to deviate from his established
usage.&nbsp; He ordered his servant to assist the stranger in
undressing, and to take care of him till he was in bed.</p>
<p>Francis found his bed an excellent one; and ere he went to
sleep, he owned that so handsome a reception could not be dearly
bought at the expense of a trifling beating.&nbsp; The most
delightful dreams (in which Meta bore the sway) occupied him the
whole night; and he would have gone on (thus dreaming) till
mid-day, if the sonorous voice of the chevalier and the clanking
of the spurs had not disturbed him.</p>
<p>It needed all Francis&rsquo;s efforts to quit this delightful
bed, in which he was so comfortable, and <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>where he
knew himself to be in safety; he turned from side to side; but
the chevalier&rsquo;s tremendous voice was like a death-stroke to
him, and at length he resolved to get up.&nbsp; Several servants
assisted him in dressing, and the chevalier waited for him at a
small, but well-served table; but Francis, knowing the moment of
trial was at hand, had no great inclination to feast.&nbsp; The
chevalier tried to persuade him to eat, telling him it was the
best thing to keep out the fog and the damp of the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir knight,&rdquo; replied Francis, &ldquo;my stomach
is still loaded from your excellent supper of last evening; but
my pockets are empty, and I should much like to fill them, in
order to provide against future wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chevalier evinced his pleasure at his frankness by filling
his pockets with as much as they could contain.&nbsp; As soon as
they brought him his horse, which he discovered had been well
groomed and fed, he drank the last glass of wine to say Adieu,
expecting that at that signal the chevalier would take him by the
collar and make him pay his welcome.&nbsp; But, to his no small
surprise, the chevalier contented himself with heartily shaking
him by the hand as on his arrival; and as soon as the gate was
opened, Francis rode off safe and sound.</p>
<p>In no way could our traveller account for his host permitting
him thus to depart without paying the usual score.&nbsp; At
length he began to imagine that the peasant had simply told him
the story to frighten him; and feeling a curiosity to know
whether or not it had any foundation in fact, he rode back to the
castle.&nbsp; The chevalier had not yet quitted the gate, and was
conversing <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>with the servants on the pace of Francis&rsquo;s horse,
who appeared to trot very roughly; and seeing the traveller
return, he supposed that he had forgotten something, and by his
looks seemed to accuse his servants of negligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, young man?&rdquo; demanded he:
&ldquo;Why do you, who were so much pressed for time,
return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me, most noble sir,&rdquo; replied Francis,
&ldquo;to ask you one question: It is said, that, after having
hospitably received and entertained strangers, you make them at
their departure feel the weight of your arm.&nbsp; And although I
gave credence to this rumour, I have omitted nothing which might
have entitled me to this mark of your favour.&nbsp; But, strange
to say, you have permitted me to depart in peace, without even
the slightest mark of your strength.&nbsp; You see my surprise;
therefore do pray inform me whether there is any foundation to
the report, or whether I shall chastise the impudent story-teller
who related the false tale to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; replied Bronkhorst, &ldquo;you have
heard nothing but the truth; but it needs some
explanations.&nbsp; I open my door hospitably to every stranger,
and in Christian charity I give them a place at my table; but I
am a man who hates form or disguise: I say all I think, and only
wish in return that my guests would openly and undisguisedly ask
for all they want.&nbsp; There are unfortunately, however, a
tribe of people, who fatigue by their mean complaisance and
ceremony, who wear me out by their dissimulation, and stun me by
propositions devoid of sense, or who do not conduct themselves
with decency during the feast.&nbsp; Gracious heavens! I lose all
patience when they <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>carry their fooleries to such excess, and I exert my
right as master of the castle, by taking hold of their collars,
and giving them a tolerably severe chastisement ere I turn them
out of my gates.&mdash;But a man of your sort, my young friend,
will ever be welcome under my roof; for you boldly and openly ask
for what you require, and say what you think; and such are the
persons I admire.&nbsp; If in your way back you pass through this
canton, promise me you will pay me another visit.&nbsp; Good
bye.&nbsp; Let me caution you never to place implicit confidence
in any thing you hear; believe only that there may be a single
grain of truth in the whole story; be always frank, and you will
succeed through life.&mdash;Heaven&rsquo;s blessings attend
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis continued his journey towards Anvers most gaily,
wishing as he went, that he might every where meet with as good a
reception as at the chevalier Bronkhorst&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Nothing remarkable occurred during the rest of his journey,
and he entered the city full of the most sanguine hopes and
expectations.&nbsp; In every street his fancied riches stared him
in the face.&nbsp; &ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that some of my father&rsquo;s debtors must have succeeded
in business, and that they will only require my presence, to
repay their debts with honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having rested from the fatigue of his journey, he made
himself acquainted with every particular relative to the debtors,
and learnt that the greater part had become rich, and were doing
extremely well.&nbsp; This intelligence re-animated his hopes; he
arranged his papers, and paid a visit to each of the persons who
owed him any thing.&nbsp; But his success was by no means equal
to <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>what
he had expected; some of the debtors pretended that they had paid
every thing; others that they had never heard mention of Melchior
of Bremen; and the rest produced accounts precisely contradictory
to those he had, and which tended to prove they were creditors
instead of debtors.&nbsp; In fine, ere three days had elapsed,
Francis found himself in the debtor&rsquo;s prison, from whence
he stood no chance of being released till he had paid the
uttermost farthing of his father&rsquo;s debts.</p>
<p>How pitiable was this young man&rsquo;s condition!&nbsp; Even
the horrors of the prison were augmented by the remembrance of
Meta:&mdash;nay, to such a pitch of desperation was he carried,
that he resolved to starve himself.&nbsp; Fortunately, however,
at twenty-seven years of age such determinations are more easily
formed, than practised.</p>
<p>The intention of those who put him into confinement was not
merely with a view of exacting payment of his pretended debts,
but to avoid paying him his due; so, whether the prayers put up
for poor Francis at Bremeu were effectual, or that the pretended
creditors were not disposed to maintain him during his life, I
know not; but after a detention of three months, they liberated
Francis from prison, with a particular injunction to quit the
territories of Anvers within four-and-twenty hours, and never to
set his foot within that city again:&mdash;They gave him at the
same time five florins to defray his expenses on the road.&nbsp;
As one may well imagine his horse and baggage had been sold to
defray the costs incident to the proceedings.</p>
<p>With a heart overloaded with grief he quitted Anvers, in a
very different frame of mind to what <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>he experienced at entering it.&nbsp;
Discouraged and irresolute, he mechanically followed the road
which chance directed; he paid no attention to the various
travellers, nor indeed to any object on the road, till hunger or
thirst caused him to lift up his eyes to discover a steeple or
some other token announcing the habitation of human beings.&nbsp;
In this state of mind did he continue journeying on for several
days incessantly; nevertheless, a secret instinct impelled him to
take the road leading to his own country.</p>
<p>All on a sudden he roused, as if from a profound sleep, and
recollected the place in which he was: he stopped an instant to
consider whether he should continue the road he was then in, or
return: &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what a shame to return
to my native city a beggar!&rdquo;&nbsp; How could he thus return
to that city in which he formerly felt equal to the richest of
its inhabitants?&nbsp; How could he as a beggar present himself
before Meta, without causing her to blush for the choice she had
made?&nbsp; He did not allow time for his imagination to complete
this miserable picture, for he instantly turned back, as if
already he had found himself before the gates of Bremen, followed
by the shouts of the children.&nbsp; His mind was soon made up as
to what he should do; he resolved to go to one of the ports of
the Low Countries, there to engage himself as a sailor on board
of a Spanish vessel, to go to the newly-discovered world; and not
to return to his native country till he had amassed as much
wealth as he had formerly so thoughtlessly squandered.&nbsp; In
the whole of this project, Meta was only thought of at an
immeasurable distance; but Francis contented himself with
connecting her in idea with his future plans, and <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>walked, or
rather strode along, as if by hurrying his pace he should sooner
gain possession of her.</p>
<p>Having thus attained the frontiers of the Low Countries, he
arrived at sun-set in a village situated near Rheinburg; but
since entirely destroyed in the thirty years&rsquo; war.&nbsp; A
caravan of carriers from Liege filled the inn so entirely, that
the landlord told Francis he could not give him a lodging;
adding, that at the adjoining village he would find
accommodations.&mdash;Possibly he was actuated to this refusal by
Francis&rsquo;s appearance, who certainly, in point of garb,
might well be mistaken for a vagabond.</p>
<p>The landlord took him for a spy to a band of thieves, sent
probably to rob carriers; so that poor Francis, in spite of his
extreme lassitude, was compelled, with his wallet at his back, to
proceed on his road; and having at his departure, muttered
through his teeth some maledictions against the cruel and
unfeeling landlord, the latter appeared touched with compassion
for the stranger, and from the door of the inn called after him:
&ldquo;Young man&mdash;a word with you!&nbsp; If you resolve on
passing the night here, I will procure you a lodging in that
castle you now see on the hill; there you will find rooms in
abundance, provided you are not afraid of being alone, for it is
uninhabited.&nbsp; See, here are the keys belonging to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis joyfully accepted the landlord&rsquo;s proposition,
and thanked him for it as if it had been an act of great
charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to me a matter of little moment where I pass the
night, provided I am at my ease, and have something to
eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the landlord was an ill-tempered fellow,
and wishing to revenge <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>the invectives Francis had poured
forth against him, he sent him to the castle, in order that he
might be tormented by the spirits which were said to frequent
it.</p>
<p>This castle was situated on a steep rock, and was only
separated from the village by the high road and a little
rivulet.&nbsp; Its delightful prospects caused it to be kept in
good repair, and to be well furnished, as its owner made use of
it as a hunting seat; quitting it, however, every night, in order
to avoid the apparitions and ghosts which haunted it.</p>
<p>When it was quite dark, Francis, with a lantern in his hand,
proceeded towards the castle.&nbsp; The landlord accompanied him,
and carried a little basket of provisions, to which he added a
bottle of wine (which he said would stand the test,) as well as
two candles and two wax-tapers for the night.&nbsp; Francis, not
thinking he should require so many things, and being apprehensive
he should have to pay for them, asked why they were all
brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light from my lantern,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will
suffice me till the time of my getting into bed; and ere I shall
get out of it, the sun will have risen, for I am worn out with
fatigue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not endeavour to conceal from you,&rdquo;
replied the landlord, &ldquo;that according to the current
reports, this castle is haunted by evil spirits; but do not let
that frighten you; you see I live sufficiently near, that, in
case any thing extraordinary should happen to you, I shall hear
you call, and shall be in readiness with my people to render you
any assistance.&nbsp; At my house there is somebody stirring all
night, and there is also some one constantly on the watch.&nbsp;
I have lived on <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>this spot for thirty years, and cannot say that I have
seen any thing to alarm me; indeed I believe that you may with
safety attribute any noises you hear during the night in this
castle, to cats and weasels, with which the granaries are
overrun.&nbsp; I have only provided you with the means of keeping
up a light in a case of need, for, at best, night is but a gloomy
season; and, in addition, these candles are consecrated, and
their light will undoubtedly keep off any evil spirits, should
there be such in the castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord spoke only the truth, when he said he never had
the courage to set his foot within its doors after dark; and
though he now spoke so courageously, the rogue would not have
ventured on any account to enter.&nbsp; After having opened the
door, he gave the basket to Francis, pointed out the way he was
to turn, and wished him good night; while the latter, fully
satisfied that the story of ghosts must be fabulous, gaily
entered.&nbsp; He recollected all that had been told him to the
prejudice of the Chevalier Bronkhorst, but unfortunately forgot
what that brave Castelian had recommended to him at parting,
&ldquo;always to believe there was some truth in what he might
hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conformably to the landlord&rsquo;s instructions, he went up
stairs, and came to a door, which the key in his possession soon
unlocked; it opened into a long dark gallery, where his very
steps re-echoed; the gallery led to a large hall, from which
issued a suite of apartments, furnished in a costly manner: he
surveyed them all, and made choice of one in which to pass the
night, that appeared more lively than the rest.&nbsp; The windows
looked to the high road, and every thing that passed in <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>front of
the inn could be distinctly heard.&nbsp; He lighted two candles,
spread the cloth, ate very heartily, and felt completely at his
ease, so long as he was thus employed; for while eating, no
thought or apprehension of spirits molested him; but he no sooner
arose from the table, than he began to feel a sensation strongly
resembling fear.</p>
<p>In order to render himself more secure, he locked the door,
drew the bolts, and then looked out from each window.&nbsp; Every
thing along the high road and in front of the inn was tranquil,
where, contrary to the landlord&rsquo;s assertions, not a single
light was discernible.&nbsp; The sound of the horn belonging to
the night-guard was the only thing that interrupted the silence
which universally prevailed.</p>
<p>Francis closed the windows, once looked round the room, and
after snuffing the candles, that they might burn the better, he
threw himself on the bed, which he found good and comfortable;
but although greatly fatigued, he could not get to sleep so soon
as he had hoped.&nbsp; A slight palpitation of the heart, which
he attributed to the agitation produced by the heat of his
fatiguing journey, kept him awake for a considerable time, till
at length sleep came to his aid.&nbsp; After having, as he
imagined, been asleep somewhat above an hour, he awoke and
started up in a state of horror, possibly not unusual to a person
whose blood is over-heated; this idea in some degree allayed his
apprehensions, and he listened attentively, but could hear
nothing excepting the clock, which struck the hour of
midnight.&nbsp; Again he listened for an instant, and turning on
his side, he was just going off to sleep, when he thought he
heard a distant door grinding on its hinges, <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>and then
shut with a heavy noise.&nbsp; In an instant the idea of the
ghost approaching caused him no little fear; but he speedily got
the better of his alarm, by fancying it was only the wind;
however, he could not comfort himself long with this belief, for
the sound approached nearer and nearer, and resembled the
clanking of chains, or the rattling of a bunch of keys.</p>
<p>The terror which Francis experienced was beyond all
description, and he put his head under the clothes.&nbsp; The
doors continued to open with a frightful noise, and at last he
heard some one trying different keys at the door of his room; one
of them seemed perfectly to fit the lock, but the bolts kept the
door fast, however, a violent shock like a clap of thunder caused
them to give way, and in stalked a tall thin figure, with a black
beard, whose appearance was indicative of chagrin and
melancholy.&nbsp; He was habited in the antique style, and on his
left shoulder wore a red cloak or mantle, while his head was
covered with a high-crowned hat.&nbsp; Three times with slow and
measured steps he walked round the room, examined the consecrated
candles and snuffed them: he then threw off his cloak, unfolded a
shaving apparatus, and took from it the razors, which he
sharpened on a large leather strap hanging to the belt.</p>
<p>No powers are adequate to describe the agonies Francis
endured: he recommended himself to the Virgin Mary, and
endeavoured, as well as his fears would permit, to form an idea
of the spectre&rsquo;s designs on him.&nbsp; Whether he purposed
to cut his throat, or only take off his beard, he was at a loss
to determine.&nbsp; The poor traveller was a little more
composed, when he saw the <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>spectre take out a silver shaving
pot, and in a bason of the same metal put some water; after which
he made a lather, and placed a chair.&nbsp; But a cold
perspiration came over Francis, when the spectre with a grave
air, made signs for him to sit in that chair.</p>
<p>He knew it was useless to resist this mandate, which was but
too plainly given; and thinking it most prudent to make a virtue
of necessity, and to put a good face on the matter, Francis
obeyed the order, jumped nimbly out of bed, and seated himself as
directed.</p>
<p>The spirit placed the shaving-bib round his neck; then taking
a comb and scissors, cut off his hair and whiskers; after which
he lathered, according to rule, his beard, his eye-brows, and
head, and shaved them all off completely from his chin to the
nape of his neck.&nbsp; This operation ended, he washed his head,
wiped and dried it very nicely, made him a low bow, folded up his
case, put his cloak on his shoulder, and made towards the door to
go away.</p>
<p>The consecrated candles had burnt most brilliantly during this
operation; and by their clear light Francis discovered, on
looking into the glass, that he had not a single hair remaining
on his head.&nbsp; Most bitterly did he deplore the loss of his
beautiful brown hair; but he regained courage on remarking, that,
however great the sacrifice, all was now over, and that the
spirit had no more power over him.</p>
<p>In effect, the ghost walked towards the door with as grave an
air as he had entered; but after going a few steps, he stopped,
looked at Francis, with a mournful air, and stroked his
beard.&nbsp; He three times repeated this action; and was on the
<a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>point of
quitting the room, when Francis imagined he wanted
something.&nbsp; With great quickness of thought he imagined it
might be that he wished him to perform a like service for him to
that which he had just been executing on himself.</p>
<p>As the spectre, spite of his woe-begone aspect, appeared more
inclined to raillery than gravity, and as his proceedings towards
Francis appeared more of a species of frolic than absolute
ill-treatment, the latter no longer appeared to entertain any
apprehension of him; and in consequence determined to hazard the
adventure.&nbsp; He therefore beckoned the phantom to seat
himself in the chair.&nbsp; It instantly returned and obeyed;
taking off its cloak, and unfolding the case, placed it on the
table, and seated itself in the chair, in the attitude of one
about to be shaved.&nbsp; Francis imitated precisely all he had
seen it do: he cut off its hair and whiskers, and then lathered
its head.&nbsp; The spirit did not move an inch.&nbsp; Our
barber&rsquo;s apprentice did not handle the razor very
dexterously; so that having taken hold of the ghost&rsquo;s beard
against the grain, the latter made a horrible grimace.&nbsp;
Francis did not feel much assured by this action; however, he got
through the job as well as he could, and rendered the
ghost&rsquo;s head as bald as his own.</p>
<p>Hitherto the scene between the two performers had passed in
profound silence: but on a sudden it was interrupted by the ghost
exclaiming, with a smiling countenance&mdash;&ldquo;Stranger, I
heartily thank you for the eminent service you have rendered me;
for to you I am indebted for deliverance from my long
captivity.&nbsp; During the space of three hundred years I have
been immersed within these walls, and my soul has been condemned
<a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>to
submit to this chastisement as a punishment for my crimes, until
some living being had the courage to exercise retaliation on me,
by doing to me what I have done by others during my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count Hartmann formerly resided in this castle; he was
a man who recognised no law nor superior; was of an arrogant and
overbearing disposition; committed every species of wickedness,
and violated the most sacred rights of hospitality; he played all
sorts of malicious tricks to strangers who sought refuge under
his roof, and to the poor who solicited his charity.&nbsp; I was
his barber, and did every thing to please him.&nbsp; No sooner
did I perceive a pious pilgrim, than in an endearing tone I urged
him to come into the castle, and prepared a bath for him; and
while he was enjoying the idea of being taken care of, I shaved
his beard and head quite close, and then turned him out of the
bye door with raillery and ridicule.&nbsp; All this was seen by
Count Hartmann from his window with a sort of devilish pleasure,
while the children would assemble round the abused stranger and
pursue him with cries of derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day there came a holy man from a far distant
country: he wore a plenipotentiary cross at his back, and his
devotion had imprinted scars on his feet, hands, and sides; his
head was shaved, excepting a circle of hair, left to resemble the
crown of thorns worn by our Saviour.&nbsp; He asked for some
water to wash his feet as he passed by, and some bread to
eat.&nbsp; I instantly put him into the bath; but did not respect
even his venerable head.&nbsp; Upon which the pilgrim pronounced
this terrible curse on me.&mdash;&lsquo;Depraved wretch,&rsquo;
said <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>he,
&lsquo;know that at your death, the formidable gates of heaven,
of hell, and of purgatory, will alike be closed against your
sinful soul, which shall wander through this castle, in the form
of a ghost, until some man, without being invited or constrained,
shall do to you, what you have so long done to others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that moment the marrow in my bones dried up, and I
became a perfect shadow; my soul quitted my emaciated body, which
remained wandering within these walls, according to the
prediction of the holy man.&nbsp; In vain did I look and hope for
release from the painful ties which held me to earth; for know
that no sooner is the soul separated from the body, than it
aspires to the blissful regions of peace, and the ardour of its
wishes causes years to appear as long as centuries, while it
languishes in a strange element.&nbsp; As a punishment, I was
compelled to continue the trade I had exercised during my life;
but, alas! my nocturnal appearance soon rendered this castle
deserted.&nbsp; Now and then a poor pilgrim entered to pass the
night here: when they did, however, I treated them all as I have
done you; but not one has understood me, or rendered me the only
service which would deliver my soul from this sad servitude;
henceforth, no spirit will haunt this castle, for I shall now
enjoy that repose of which I have been so long in search.&nbsp;
Once again let me thank you, gallant youth; and believe, that had
I power over the hidden treasures of the globe, I would give them
all to you, but unfortunately, during my life riches did not fall
to my lot, and this castle contains no store; however, listen to
the advice I am about to give you.</p>
<p><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>&ldquo;Remain here till your hair is grown again; then
return to your own country; and at that period of the year when
the days and nights are of equal length, go on the bridge which
crosses the Weser, and there remain till a friend, whom you shall
there meet, shall tell you what you ought to do to get possession
of terrestrial wealth.&nbsp; When you are rolling in riches and
prosperity, remember me; and on every anniversary of the day on
which you released me from the heavy maledictions which
overwhelmed me, cause a mass to be said for the repose of my
soul.&nbsp; Adieu!&nbsp; I must now leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus saying, the phantom vanished, and left his liberator
perfectly astonished at the strange history he had just
related.&nbsp; For a considerable time Francis remained
immoveable, and reasoned within himself as to the reality of what
he had seen; for he could not help fancying still that it was
only a dream; but his closely shaved head soon convinced him that
the event had actually taken place.&nbsp; He got into bed again,
and slept soundly until mid-day.</p>
<p>The malicious inn-keeper had been on the watch from the dawn
of day for the appearance of the traveller, in order that he
might enjoy a laugh at his expense, and express his surprise at
the night&rsquo;s adventure.&nbsp; But after waiting till his
patience was nearly exhausted, and finding it approached to noon,
he began to apprehend that the spirit had either strangled the
stranger, or that he had died of fright.&nbsp; He therefore
called his servants together, and ran with them to the castle,
passing through every room till they reached the one in which he
had observed the light the over-night; there he found a strange
key in the door, which <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>was still bolted; for Francis had
drawn the bolts after the ghost had vanished.&nbsp; The landlord,
who was all anxiety, knocked loudly; and Francis on waking, at
first thought that it was the phantom come to pay him another
visit; but at length recognising the landlord&rsquo;s voice, he
got up and opened the door.</p>
<p>The landlord, affecting the utmost possible astonishment,
clasped his hands, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Great God and all the
saints! then the red cloak has actually been here and shaved you
completely?&nbsp; I now see that the story is but too well
founded.&nbsp; But pray relate to me all the particulars; tell me
what the spirit was like; how he came thus to shave you; and what
he said to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis, having sense enough to discover his roguery, answered
him by saying: &ldquo;The spirit resembled a man wearing a red
cloak; you know full well how he performed the operation; and his
conversation I perfectly remember;&mdash;listen
attentively:&mdash;&lsquo;Stranger,&rsquo; said he to me,
&lsquo;do not trust to a certain inn-keeper, who has a figure of
malice for his sign; the rogue well knew what would happen to
you.&mdash;Adieu! I now quit this abode, as my time is come; and
in future no spirit will make its appearance here.&nbsp; I am now
to be transformed into a night-mare, and shall constantly torment
and haunt this said inn-keeper, unless he does penance for his
villainy, by lodging, feeding, and furnishing you with every
thing needful, till your hair shall grow again, and fall in
ringlets over your shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, the landlord was seized with a violent
trembling: he crossed himself and vowed to the Virgin Mary, that
he would take care of the young stranger, lodge him, and give him
every <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>thing he required free of cost.&nbsp; He then conducted
him to his house, and faithfully fulfilled what he promised.</p>
<p>The spirit being no longer heard or seen, Francis was
naturally looked on as a conjurer.&nbsp; He several times passed
a night in the castle; and one evening a courageous villager
accompanied him, and returned without having lost his hair.&nbsp;
The lord of the castle, hearing that the formidable Red Cloak was
no longer to be seen, was quite delighted; and gave orders that
the stranger who had delivered him from this spirit should be
well taken care of.</p>
<p>Early in the month of September, Francis&rsquo;s hair began to
form into ringlets, and he prepared to depart; for all his
thoughts were directed towards the bridge over the Weser, where
he hoped, according to the barber&rsquo;s predictions, to find
the friend who would point out to him the way to make his
fortune.</p>
<p>When Francis took leave of the landlord, the latter presented
him with a handsome horse well appointed, and loaded with a large
cloak-bag on the back of the saddle, and gave him at the same
time a sufficient sum of money to complete his journey.&nbsp;
This was a present from the lord of the castle, expressive of his
thanks for having his castle again rendered habitable.</p>
<p>Francis arrived at his native place in high spirits.&nbsp; He
returned to his lodging in the little street, where he lived very
retired, contenting himself for the present with secret
information respecting Meta.&nbsp; All the tidings he thus gained
were of a satisfactory nature; but he would neither visit her,
nor make her acquainted with his return, till his fate was
decided.</p>
<p><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>He
waited with the utmost impatience for the equinox; till which,
time seemed immeasurably long.&nbsp; The night preceding the
eventful day, he could not close his eyes to sleep; and that he
might be sure of not missing the friend with whom he was as yet
unacquainted, he took his station ere sun-rise on the bridge,
where no human being but himself was to be discovered.&nbsp;
Replete with hopes of future good fortune, he formed a thousand
projects in what way he should spend his money.</p>
<p>Already had he during the space of an hour, traversed the
bridge alone, giving full scope to his imagination; when on a
sudden the bridge presented a moving scene, and amongst others,
many beggars took their several stations on it, to levy
contributions on the passengers.&nbsp; The first of this tribe
who asked charity of Francis was a poor vagabond with a wooden
leg, who, being a pretty good physiognomist, judged from the gay
and contented air of the young man, that his request would be
crowned with success; and his conjecture was not erroneous, for
he threw a demi-florin into his hat.</p>
<p>Francis, meanwhile, feeling persuaded that the friend he
expected must belong to the highest class of society, felt no
surprise at not seeing him at so early an hour, and waited
therefore with patience.&nbsp; But as the hour for visiting the
Exchange and Courts of Justice drew near, his eyes were in
constant motion.&nbsp; He discovered at an immense distance every
well-dressed person who came on the bridge, and his blood was in
a perfect ferment as each approached him, for in some one of them
did he hope to discover the author of his good fortune; but in
vain he looked people <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>in the face, no one paid attention
to him.&nbsp; The beggars, who at noon were seated on the ground
eating their dinner, remarking that the young man they had seen
from the first of the morning, was the only person remaining with
them on the bridge, and that he had not spoken to any one, or
appeared to have any employment, took him for a lazy vagabond;
and although they had received marks of his beneficence, they
began to make game of him, and in derision called him the provost
of the bridge.&nbsp; The physiognomist with the wooden leg
observed, that his air was no longer so gay as in the morning,
and that having drawn his hat over his face, he appeared entirely
lost in thought, for he walked slowly along, nibbling an apple,
with an abstracted air.&nbsp; The observer, resolving to benefit
by what he had remarked, went to the further extremity of the
bridge, and after well examining the visionary, came up to him as
a stranger, asked his charity, and succeeded to his utmost wish;
for Francis, without turning round his head, gave him another
demi-florin.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a crowd of new faces presented themselves to
Francis&rsquo;s observation, while he became quite weary at his
friend&rsquo;s tardiness; but hope still kept up his
attention.&nbsp; However, the fast declining sun gave notice of
the approach of night, and yet scarcely any of the passers-by had
noticed Francis.&nbsp; Some few, perhaps, had returned his
salutation, but not one had, as he expected and hoped, embraced
him.&nbsp; At length, the day so visibly declined, that the
bridge became nearly deserted; for even the beggars went
away.&nbsp; A profound melancholy seized the heart of poor
Francis, when he found his hopes thus deceived; <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>and giving
way to despair, he would have precipitated himself into the
Weser, had not the recollection of Meta deterred him.&nbsp; He
felt anxious, ere he terminated his days in so tragical a manner,
to see her once again as she went to mass, and feast on the
contemplation of her features.</p>
<p>He was preparing to quit the bridge, when the beggar with the
wooden leg accosted him, for he had in vain puzzled his brain to
discover what could possibly have caused the young man to remain
on the bridge from morning till night.&nbsp; The poor cripple had
waited longer than usual on account of Francis, in order to see
when he went; but as he remained longer than he wished, curiosity
at length induced him openly to address him, in order to learn
what he so ardently desired to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse me, worthy sir,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;and
permit me to ask you a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis, who was by no means in a mood to talk, and who now
heard from the mouth of a beggar the words which he had so
anxiously expected from a friend, answered him in rather an angry
tone: &ldquo;Well then, what is it you want to know, old
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you and I were the first persons on this bridge
to-day; and here we are still the only remaining two.&nbsp; As
for me and my companions, it is pretty clear that we only came to
ask alms; but it is equally evident you do not belong to our
profession, and yet you have not quitted the bridge the whole
day.&nbsp; My dear sir, for the love of God, if it is no secret,
tell me, I entreat you, for what purpose you came, and what is
the grief that rends your heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>&ldquo;What can it concern you, old dotard, to know
where the shoe pinches me, or what afflictions I am labouring
under?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good sir, I wish you well: you have twice bestowed
your charity on me, which I hope the Almighty will return to you
with interest.&nbsp; I could not but observe, however, this
evening your countenance no longer looked gay and happy as in the
morning; and, believe me, I was sorry to see the
change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unaffected interest evinced by the old man pleased
Francis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;since you
attach so much importance to the knowledge of the reason I have
for remaining the whole day here plaguing myself, I will inform
you that I came here in search of a friend who appointed to meet
me on this bridge, but whom I have expected in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission I should say your friend was a
rogue, to play the fool with you in this manner.&nbsp; If he had
so served me, I should make him feel the weight of my crutch
whenever I met him; for if he has been prevented from keeping his
word by any unseen obstacle, he ought at least to have sent to
you, and not have kept you here on your feet a whole
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I have no reason to complain of his not coming,
for he promised me nothing.&nbsp; In fact it was only a dream
that I was told I should meet a friend here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis spoke of it as a dream, because the history of the
ghost was too long to relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That alters the case,&rdquo; replied the old man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Since you rest your hopes on dreams, I am not astonished
at your being deceived.&nbsp; I have also had many dreams in my
life; but I was never <a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>fool enough to pay attention to
them.&nbsp; If I had all the treasures that have been promised me
in dreams, I could purchase the whole city of Bremen; but I have
never put faith in dreams, and have not taken a single step to
prove whether they were true or false; for I know full well, it
would be useless trouble; and I am astonished that you should
have lost so fine a day, which you might have employed so much
more usefully, merely on the strength of a dream, which appears
to me so wholly devoid of sense or meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The event proves the justness of your remark, old
father; and that dreams generally are deceitful.&nbsp; But it is
rather more than three months since I had a very circumstantial
dream relative to my meeting a friend on this particular day,
here on this bridge; and it was so clearly indicated that he
should communicate things of the utmost importance, that I
thought it worth while to ascertain whether this dream had any
foundation in truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir, no one has had clearer dreams than myself; and
one of them I shall never forget.&nbsp; I dreamt, several years
since, that my good angel stood at the foot of my bed, in the
form of a young man, and addressed me as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Berthold, listen attentively to my words,
and do not lose any part of what I am about to say.&nbsp; A
treasure is allotted to you; go and secure it, that you may be
enabled to live happily the rest of your days.&nbsp; To-morrow
evening, when the sun is setting, take a pick-axe and spade over
your shoulder, and go out of the city by the gate leading to
Hamburgh; when you arrive facing the convent of St. Nicholas, you
will see a garden, the entrance to which is ornamented by two
pillars; <a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>conceal yourself behind one of these until the moon
rises; then push the door hard, and it will yield to your
efforts; go without fear into the garden, follow a walk covered
by a treillage of vines, and to the left you will see a great
apple-tree; place yourself at the foot of the tree, with your
face turned towards the moon, and you will perceive at fifteen
feet distance, two bushy rose-trees; search between these two
shrubs, and at the depth of about six feet you will discover a
great flag-stone, which covers the treasure enclosed within an
iron chest; and although it is heavy and difficult to handle, do
not regret the labour it will occasion you to remove it from the
hole where it now is.&nbsp; You will be well rewarded for your
pains and trouble, if you look for the key which is under the
box.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis remained like one stupified at this recital; and
certainly would have been unable to conceal his astonishment, if
the darkness of the night had not favoured him.&nbsp; The various
particulars pointed out by the beggar brought to his recollection
a little garden which he had inherited from his father, and which
garden was the favourite spot of that good man; but possibly for
that very reason it was not held in estimation by the son.&nbsp;
Melchior had caused it to be laid out according to his own taste,
and his son in the height of his extravagance had sold it at a
very low price.</p>
<p>The beggar with his wooden leg was become a very interesting
personage to Francis, who perceived that he was the friend
alluded to by the ghost in the castle of Rummelsbourg.&nbsp; The
first impulse of joy would have led him to embrace the mendicant;
but he restrained his feelings, <a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>thinking it best not to communicate
the result of his intelligence to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my good man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what did you
when you awoke? did you not attend to the advice given by your
good angel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I undertake a hopeless labour?&nbsp; It was
only a vague dream; and if my good angel was anxious to appear to
me, he might choose a night when I am not sleeping, which occurs
but too frequently; but he has not troubled his head much about
me; for if he had, I should not have been reduced, as I am now,
to his shame, to beg my bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis took from his pocket another piece of money, and gave
it to the old man, saying, &ldquo;Take this to procure half a
pint of wine, and drink it ere you retire to rest.&nbsp; Your
conversation has dispelled my sorrowful thoughts; do not fail to
come regularly to this bridge, where I hope we shall meet
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lame man, not having for a long while made so good a
day&rsquo;s work, overwhelmed Francis with his grateful
benedictions.&nbsp; They separated, and each went his way.&nbsp;
Francis, whose joy was at its height from the near prospect of
his hopes being realised, very speedily reached his lodging in
the bye street.</p>
<p>The following day he ran to the purchaser of the little
garden, and proposed to re-purchase it.&nbsp; The latter, to whom
this property was of no particular value, and who, indeed, began
to be tired of it, willingly consented to part with it.&nbsp;
They very soon agreed as to the conditions of the purchase, and
went immediately to sign the contract: with the money he had
found in his bag, as a gift from the lord of Rummelsbourg,
Francis paid down half the price: he then procured the necessary
<a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>tools
for digging a hole in the earth, conveyed them to the garden,
waited till the moon was up, strictly adhered to the instructions
given him by the old beggar, set to work, and without any unlucky
adventure he obtained the hidden treasure.</p>
<p>His father, as a precaution against necessity, had buried this
money, without any intention to deprive his son of this
considerable portion of his inheritance; but dying suddenly, he
had carried the secret to his grave, and nothing but a happy
combination of circumstances, could have restored this lost
treasure to its rightful owner.</p>
<p>The chest, filled with gold pieces, was too heavy for Francis
to remove to his lodging without employing some person to assist
him; and feeling unwilling to become a topic of general
conversation, he preferred concealing it in the summer-house
belonging to the garden, and fetching it at several times.&nbsp;
On the third day the whole was safely conveyed to his lodging in
the back street.</p>
<p>Francis dressed himself in the best possible style, and went
to church to request that the priest would substitute for the
prayers which had been previously offered up, a thanksgiving for
the safe return of a traveller to his native country, after
having happily terminated his business.&nbsp; He concealed
himself in a corner, where, unseen, he could observe Meta.&nbsp;
The sight of her gave him inexpressible delight, especially when
he saw the beautiful blush which overspread her cheeks, and the
brilliancy of her eyes, when the priest offered up the
thanksgiving.&nbsp; A secret meeting took place, as had been
formerly arranged: and so much was Meta affected by it, that any
indifferent person might have divined the cause.&nbsp; Francis
repaired to the Exchange, set up again <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>in
business, and in a very short time had enough to do; his fortune
each succeeding day becoming better known, his neighbours judged
that he had had greater luck than sense in his journey to collect
his father&rsquo;s debts.&nbsp; He hired a large house in the
best part of the town, engaged clerks, and continued his business
with laudable and indefatigable assiduity: he conducted himself
with the utmost propriety and sagacity, and abstained from the
foolish extravagances which had formerly been his ruin.</p>
<p>The re-establishment of Francis&rsquo;s fortune formed the
general topic of conversation.&nbsp; Every one was astonished at
the success of his foreign voyage: but in proportion to the
spreading fame of his riches, did Meta&rsquo;s tranquillity and
happiness diminish; for it appeared that the silent lover was now
in a condition to declare himself, and yet he remained dumb, and
only manifested his love by the usual rencontre on coming out of
church; and even this species of rendezvous became less frequent,
which appeared to evince a diminution of his affection.</p>
<p>Poor Meta&rsquo;s heart was now torn by jealousy; for she
imagined that the inconstant Francis was offering up his vows to
some other beauty.&nbsp; She had experienced secret transports of
delight on learning the change of fortune of the man she loved,
not from interested motives and the wish to participate in his
better fortune herself, but from affection to her mother, who,
since the failure of the match with the rich brewer, absolutely
seemed to despair of every enjoying happiness or comfort in this
world.&nbsp; When she thought Francis faithless, she wished that
the prayers put up for him in the church had not been heard, and
<a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>that his
journey had not been attended with such success; for had he been
reduced to means merely sufficient to procure the necessaries of
life, in all probability he would have shared them with her.</p>
<p>Mother Bridget failed not to perceive her daughter&rsquo;s
uneasiness, and easily guessed the cause; for she had heard of
her old neighbour&rsquo;s surprising return, and she knew he was
now considered an industrious, intelligent merchant: therefore
she thought if his love for her daughter was what it ought to be,
he would not be thus tardy in declaring it; for she well knew
Meta&rsquo;s sentiments towards him.&nbsp; However, feeling
anxious to avoid the probability of wounding her daughter&rsquo;s
feelings, she avoided mentioning the subject to her; but the
latter, no longer able to confine her grief to her own bosom,
disclosed it to her mother, and confided the whole to her.</p>
<p>Mother Bridget did not reproach her daughter for her past
conduct, but employed all her eloquence to console her, and
entreat her to bear up with courage under the loss of all her
hopes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must resign him,&rdquo; said she:
&ldquo;you scorned at the happiness which presented itself to
your acceptance, therefore you must now endeavour to be resigned
at its departure.&nbsp; Experience has taught me that those hopes
which appear to be the best founded are frequently the most
delusive; follow my example, and never again deliver up your
heart.&nbsp; Do not reckon on any amelioration of your condition,
and you will be contented with your lot.&nbsp; Honour this
spinning-wheel, which produces the means of your subsistence, and
then fortune and riches will be immaterial to you: you may do
without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus saying, mother Bridget turned the wheel <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>round with
redoubled velocity, in order to make up for the time lost in
conversation.&nbsp; She spoke nothing but the truth to her
daughter; for, since the opportunity was gone by when she hoped
it was possible to have regained her lost comforts, she had in
such a manner simplified her present wants and projects of future
life, that it was not in the power of destiny to produce any
considerable derangement in them.&nbsp; But as yet Meta was not
so great a philosopher; so that her mother&rsquo;s exhortations,
consolations, and doctrines, produced a precisely different
effect on her from what they were intended.&nbsp; Meta looked on
herself as the destroyer of the flattering hopes her mother had
entertained.&nbsp; Although she did not formally accept the offer
of marriage proposed to her, and even then could not have
reckoned on possessing beyond the common necessaries of life;
yet, since she had heard the tidings of the great fortune
obtained by the man of her heart, her views had become enlarged,
and she anticipated with pleasure that by her choice she might
realise her mother&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>Now, however, this golden dream had vanished: Francis would
not come again; and, indeed, they even began to talk of an
alliance about to take place between him and a very rich young
lady of Anvers.&nbsp; The news was a death-blow to poor Meta: she
vowed she would banish him from her thoughts; but still she shed
very many tears.</p>
<p>Contrary, however, to her vow, she was one day thinking of the
faithless one; for whenever she filled her spinning-wheel, she
thought of the following distich, which her mother had frequently
repeated to her to encourage her in her work.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Spin the thread well, spin, spin it
more,<br />
For see your intended is now at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>Some
one did in reality knock gently at the door: and mother Bridget
went to see who it was.&nbsp; Francis entered, attired as for the
celebration of a wedding.&nbsp; Surprise for a while suspended
mother Bridget&rsquo;s faculties of speech.&nbsp; Meta blushed
deeply, and trembling, arose from her seat, but was equally
unable with her mother to say a word.&nbsp; Francis was the only
one of the three who could speak; and he candidly declared his
love, and demanded of Bridget the hand of her daughter.&nbsp; The
good mother ever attentive to forms, asked eight days to consider
the matter, although the tears of joy which she shed, plainly
evinced her ready and prompt acquiescence; but Francis, all
impatience, would hear of no delay: finding which, she,
conformable to her duty as a mother, willing to satisfy
Francis&rsquo;s ardour, adopted a midway, and left the decision
to her daughter.&nbsp; The latter, obeying the dictates of her
own heart, placed herself by the side of the object of her
tenderest affection; and Francis, transported with joy, thanked
her with a kiss.</p>
<p>The two lovers then entertained themselves with talking over
the delights of the time when they so well communicated their
sentiments by signs.&nbsp; Francis had great difficulty in
tearing himself away from Meta, and such &ldquo;converse
sweet,&rdquo; but he had an important duty to fulfil.</p>
<p>He directed his steps towards the bridge over the Weser, where
he hoped to find his old friend with the wooden leg, whom he had
by no means forgotten, although he had delayed making the
promised visit.&nbsp; The latter instantly recognised Francis;
and no sooner saw him at the foot of the bridge, than he came to
meet him, and showed evident marks of pleasure at the sight of
him.&nbsp; <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>&ldquo;Can you, my friend,&rdquo; said Francis to him,
after returning his salutation, &ldquo;come with me into the new
town and execute a commission? you will be well rewarded for your
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&mdash;with my wooden leg I walk about just as
well as other people; and, indeed, have an advantage over them,
for it is never fatigued.&nbsp; I beg you, however, my good sir,
to have the kindness to wait till the man with the grey greatcoat
arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has this man with the grey great-coat to do with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He every day comes as evening approaches and gives me a
demi-florin; I know not from whom.&nbsp; It is not, indeed,
always proper to learn all things; so I do not breathe a
word.&nbsp; I am sometimes tempted to believe, that it is the
devil who is anxious to buy my soul; but it matters little, I
have not consented to the bargain, therefore it cannot be
valid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I verily believe that grey surtout has some malice in
his head: so follow me; and you shall have a quarter-florin over
and above the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis conducted the old man to a distant corner, near the
ramparts of the city, stopped before a newly-built house, and
knocked at the door.&nbsp; As soon as the door was opened, he
thus addressed the old beggar:&mdash;&ldquo;You have procured a
very agreeable evening for me in the course of my life; it is but
just, therefore, that I should shed some comfort and joy over
your declining days.&nbsp; This house and every thing
appertaining thereto belongs to you.&nbsp; The kitchen and cellar
are both well stocked; there is a person to take care of you, and
every day at dinner you will find a quarter-florin under your
plate.&nbsp; It is now <a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>time for you to know that the man in
the grey surtout is my servant, whom I every day sent with my
alms till this house was ready to receive you.&nbsp; You may, if
you please, consider me as your guardian angel, since your good
angel did not acquit himself uprightly in return for your
gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, he made the old man go into the house, where the
latter found every thing he could possibly desire or want.&nbsp;
The table was spread; and the old man was so much astonished at
his unexpected good fortune, that he thought it must be a dream;
for he could in no way imagine why a rich man should feel so much
interest for a miserable beggar.&nbsp; Francis having again
assured him that every thing he saw was his own, a torrent of
tears expressed his thanks; and before he could sufficiently
recover to express his gratitude by words, Francis had
vanished.</p>
<p>The following day, mother Bridget&rsquo;s house was filled
with merchants and shopkeepers of all descriptions, whom Francis
had sent to Meta, in order that she might purchase and get ready
every thing she required for her appearance in the world with
suitable &eacute;clat.&nbsp; Three weeks afterwards he conducted
her to the altar.&nbsp; The splendour of the wedding far exceeded
that of the King of Hops.&nbsp; Mother Bridget enjoyed the
satisfaction of adorning her daughter&rsquo;s forehead with the
nuptial crown, and thereby obtained the accomplishment of all her
desires, and was recompensed for her virtuous and active
life.&nbsp; She witnessed her daughter&rsquo;s happiness with
delight, and proved the very best of grandmothers to her
daughter&rsquo;s children.</p>
<h2><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>THE
SLEEPING FRIAR;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR,</span><br />
THE STONE OF FATHER CUDDY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Above</span> all the islands in the Lakes
of Killarney, give me Innisfallen&mdash;&ldquo;sweet
Innisfallen,&rdquo; as the melodious Moore calls it.&nbsp; It is
in truth a fairy isle, although I have no fairy story to tell you
about it; and if I had these are such unbelieving times, and
people of late have grown so sceptical, that they only smile at
my stones and doubt them.</p>
<p>However none will doubt that a monastery stood once upon
Innisfallen Island, for its ruins may still be seen; neither,
that within its walls dwelt certain pious and learned persons
called monks.&nbsp; A very pleasant set of fellows they were, I
make not the least doubt; and I am sure of this, that they had a
very pleasant spot to enjoy themselves in after dinner:&mdash;the
proper time, believe me, and I am no bad judge of such matters,
for the enjoyment of a fine prospect.</p>
<p>Out of all the monks you could not pick a better fellow nor a
merrier soul than Father Cuddy;&mdash;he sang a good song, he
told a good story, and had a jolly, comfortable-looking paunch of
his own that was a credit to any refectory table.&nbsp; He was
distinguished by the name of &ldquo;the fat Father.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now there are many that will take huff at a name: but Father
Cuddy had no nonsense of that kind about <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>him; he
laughed at it, and well able he was to laugh, for his mouth
nearly reached from one ear to the other,&mdash;his might in
truth be called an open countenance.&nbsp; As his paunch was no
disgrace to his food, neither was his nose to his drink.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a question to me if there were not more carbuncles
upon it than ever were seen at the bottom of the lake, which is
said to be full of them.&nbsp; His eyes had a right merry twinkle
in them, like moonshine dancing on the water, and his cheeks had
the roundness and crimson glow of ripe arbutus berries.</p>
<p class="poetry">He ate, and drank, and prayed, and
slept,&mdash;what then?<br />
He ate, and drank, and prayed, and slept again!</p>
<p>Such was the tenor of his simple life; but when he prayed a
certain drowsiness would come upon him, which it must be
confessed never occurred when a well filled
&lsquo;black-jack&rsquo; stood before him.&nbsp; Hence his
prayers were short, and his draughts were long.&nbsp; The world
loved him, and he saw no reason why he should not in return love
its venison and its usquebaugh.&nbsp; But, as times went, he must
have been a pious man, or else what befell him never would have
happened.</p>
<p>Spiritual affairs&mdash;for it was respecting the importation
of a tun of wine into the inland monastery&mdash;demanded the
presence of one of the brotherhood of Innisfallen at the abbey of
Irelagh, now called Muckruss.&nbsp; The superintendence of this
important matter was confided to Father Cuddy, who felt too
deeply interested in the future welfare of any community of which
he was a member to neglect or delay such a mission.&nbsp; With
the morning&rsquo;s light he was seen guiding his shallop across
the crimson waters of the lake towards the peninsula of Muckruss,
and having moored his little bark in safety beneath the shelter
of a <a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>wave-worn rock, he advanced with becoming dignity
towards the abbey.</p>
<p>The stillness of the bright and balmy hour was broken by the
heavy footsteps of the zealous father:&mdash;at the sound the
startled deer, shaking the dew from their sides, sprang up from
their lair, and as they bounded off&mdash;&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo;
exclaimed Cuddy, &ldquo;what a noble haunch goes there!&mdash;how
delicious it would look smoking upon a goodly platter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he proceeded, the mountain bee hummed his tune of gladness
around the holy man, save when buried in the foxglove bell, or
revelling upon a fragrant bunch of thyme,&mdash;and even then,
the little voice murmured out happiness in low and broken tones
of voluptuous delight.&nbsp; Father Cuddy derived no small
comfort at the sound, for it presaged a good metheglin season;
and metheglin he considered no bad liquor, particularly when
there was no stint of usquebaugh in the brewing.</p>
<p>Arrived within the abbey gate, he was received with due
respect by the brethren of Irelagh, and arrangements for the
embarkation of the wine were completed to his entire
satisfaction.&mdash;&ldquo;Welcome, Father Cuddy!&rdquo; said the
prior, &ldquo;grace be on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grace before meat then,&rdquo; said Cuddy, &ldquo;for a
long walk always makes me hungry, and I am certain I have not
walked less than half a mile this morning, to say nothing of
crossing the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pasty of choice flavour felt the truth of this assertion as
regarded Father Cuddy&rsquo;s appetite.&nbsp; After such
consoling repast, it would have been a reflection on monastic
hospitality to have departed without partaking of the
grace-cup:&mdash;moreover Father Cuddy had a particular respect
for the antiquity of that custom.&nbsp; He liked the taste of the
<a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>grace-cup well;&mdash;he tried another,&mdash;it was no
less excellent; and when he had swallowed the third he found his
heart expand, and put forth its fibres, as willing to embrace all
mankind!&mdash;Surely then there is christian love and charity in
wine!</p>
<p>I said he sung a good song.&nbsp; Now though psalms are good
songs, and in accordance with his vocation, I did not mean to
imply that he was a mere psalm-singer.&nbsp; It was well known to
the brethren, that wherever Father Cuddy was, mirth and melody
were with him.&nbsp; Mirth in his eye, and melody on his tongue;
and these, from experience, are equally well known to be thirsty
commodities; but he took good care never to let them run
dry.&nbsp; To please the brotherhood, whose excellent wine
pleased him, he sung, and as &ldquo;in vino veritas,&rdquo; his
song will well become this veritable history, I give it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O &rsquo;tis eggs are a treat<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When so white and so sweet<br />
From under the manger they&rsquo;re taken:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And by fair Margery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Och! &rsquo;tis she&rsquo;s full of glee,<br />
They are fried with fat rashers of bacon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like daisies all spread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er a broad sunny mead<br />
In the sun-beams so beauteously shining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are fried eggs well displayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a dish, when we&rsquo;ve laid<br />
The cloth, and are thinking of dining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was his song.&nbsp; Father Cuddy smacked his lips at the
recollection of Margery&rsquo;s delicious fried eggs, which
always imparted a peculiar relish to his liquor.&nbsp; The very
idea caused Cuddy to raise the cup to his mouth, and, with one
hearty pull thereat, he finished its contents.</p>
<p>This is, and ever was, a censorious world, often construing
what is only a fair allowance into an excess;&mdash;but I scorn
to reckon on any man&rsquo;s <a name="page315"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 315</span>drink like an unrelenting host;
therefore I cannot tell how many brimming draughts of wine,
bedecked with the venerable Bead, Father Cuddy emptied into his
&ldquo;soul-case,&rdquo;&mdash;so he figuratively termed the
body.</p>
<p>His respects for the goodly company of the monks of Irelagh
detained him until their adjournment to vespers, when he set
forward on his return to Innisfallen.&nbsp; Whether his mind was
occupied in philosophic contemplation or wrapped in pious
musings, I cannot declare; but the honest Father wandered on in a
different direction from that in which his shallop lay.&nbsp; Far
be it from me to insinuate that the good liquor, which he had so
commended, had caused him to forget his road, or that his track
was irregular and unsteady.&nbsp; Oh no! he carried his drink
bravely, as became a decent man and a good christian; yet
somehow, he thought he could distinguish two moons.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bless my eyes,&rdquo; said Father Cuddy, &ldquo;everything
is changed now-a-days!&mdash;the very stars are not in the same
places they used to be;&mdash;I think Camc&eacute;achta (the
plough) is driving on at a rate I never saw it before to-night,
but suppose the driver is drunk, for there are blackguards
everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cuddy had scarcely uttered these words, when he saw, or
fancied he saw, the form of a young woman; who, holding up a
bottle, beckoned him towards her.&nbsp; The night was extremely
beautiful, and the white dress of the girl floated gracefully in
the moonlight, as with gay step she tripped on before the worthy
Father, archly looking back upon him over her shoulder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, Margery,&mdash;merry Margery!&rdquo; cried Cuddy,
&ldquo;you <a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>tempting little rogue&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Et a Margery
bella</i>&mdash;<i>Qu&aelig; festiva puella</i>.&rsquo;&mdash;I
see you&mdash;I see you and the bottle!&mdash;let me but catch
you, Margery <i>bella</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on he followed,
panting and smiling, after this alluring apparition.</p>
<p>At length his feet grew weary, and his breath failed, which
obliged him to give up the chase; yet such was his piety, that
unwilling to rest in any attitude but that of prayer, down
dropped Father Cuddy on his knees.&nbsp; Sleep as usual stole
upon his devotions, and the morning was far advanced when he
awoke from dreams, in which tables groaned beneath their load of
viands, and wine poured itself free and sparkling as the mountain
spring.</p>
<p>Rubbing his eyes, he looked about him, and the more he looked
the more he wondered at the alterations which appeared in the
face of the country.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless my soul and body,&rdquo;
said the good Father, &ldquo;I saw the stars changing last night,
but here is a change!&rdquo;&nbsp; Doubting his senses he looked
again.&nbsp; The hills bore the same majestic outline as on the
preceding day, and the lake spread itself beneath his view in the
same tranquil beauty, and was studded with the same number of
islands; but every smaller feature in the landscape was strangely
altered;&mdash;naked rocks were now clothed with holly and
arbutus.&nbsp; Whole woods had disappeared, and waste places had
become cultivated fields; and to complete the work of enchantment
the very season itself seemed changed.&nbsp; In the rosy dawn of
a summer&rsquo;s morning he had left the monastery of
Innisfallen, and he now felt in every sight and sound the
dreariness of winter; the hard ground was covered <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>with
withered leaves;&mdash;icicles depended from leafless branches;
he heard the sweet low note of the robin who familiarly
approached him, and he felt his fingers numbed by the nipping
frost.&nbsp; Father Cuddy found it rather difficult to account
for such sudden transformations, and to convince himself it was
not the illusion of a dream he was about to arise; when lo! he
discovered that both his knees were buried at least six inches in
the solid stone: for notwithstanding all these changes, he had
never altered his devout position.</p>
<p>Cuddy was now wide awake, and felt, when he got up, his joints
sadly cramped, which it was only natural they should be,
considering the hard texture of the stone, and the depth his
knees had sunk into it.&nbsp; The great difficulty was, to
explain how, in one night, summer had become winter&mdash;whole
woods had been cut down, and well-grown trees had sprouted
up.&nbsp; The miracle, nothing else could he conclude it to be,
urged him to hasten his return to Innisfallen, where he might
learn some explanation of these marvellous events.</p>
<p>Seeing a boat moored within reach of the shore, he delayed
not, in the midst of such wonders, to seek his own bark, but,
seizing the oars, pulled stoutly towards the island; and here new
wonders awaited him.</p>
<p>Father Cuddy waddled, as fast as cramped limbs could carry his
rotund corporation, to the gate of the monastery, where he loudly
demanded admittance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa! whence come you, master monk, and what&rsquo;s
your business?&rdquo; demanded a stranger who occupied the
porter&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>&ldquo;Business&mdash;my business!&rdquo; repeated the
confounded Cuddy, &ldquo;why do you not know me?&nbsp; Has the
wine arrived safely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence, fellow,&rdquo; said the porter&rsquo;s
representative, in a surly tone, &ldquo;nor think to impose on me
with your monkish tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed the Father, &ldquo;mercy upon
us that I should be so spoken to at the gate of my own
house!&mdash;Scoundrel!&rdquo; cried Cuddy, raising his voice,
&ldquo;do you see my garb&mdash;my holy garb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, fellow,&rdquo; replied he of the keys, &ldquo;the
garb of laziness and filthy debauchery, which has long been
expelled from out these walls.&nbsp; Know you not, lazy knave, of
the suppression of this nest of superstition, and that the abbey
lands and possessions were granted in August last to Master
Robert Collan, by our Lady Elizabeth, sovereign queen of England,
and paragon of all beauty, whom God preserve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queen of England,&rdquo; said Cuddy; &ldquo;there never
was a sovereign queen of England;&mdash;this is but a piece with
the rest.&nbsp; I saw how it was going with the stars last
night&mdash;the world&rsquo;s turned upside down.&nbsp; But
surely this is Innisfallen Island, and I am the Father Cuddy who
yesterday morning went over to the Abbey of Irelagh respecting
the tun of wine.&nbsp; Do you know me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know you! how should I know you?&rdquo; said the keeper
of the abbey&mdash;&ldquo;yet true it is, that I have heard my
grandmother, whose mother remembered the man, often speak of the
fat Father Cuddy of Innisfallen, who made a profane and godless
ballad in praise of fried eggs, of which he <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>and his
vile crew knew more than they did of the word of God, and who,
being drunk, it was said, tumbled into the lake one night and was
drowned; but that must have been a hundred&mdash;ay, more than a
hundred years since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas I who composed that song, in praise of
Margery&rsquo;s fried eggs, which is no profane and godless
ballad.&nbsp; No other Father Cuddy than myself ever belonged to
Innisfallen,&rdquo; earnestly exclaimed the holy man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A hundred years!&nbsp; What was your great
grandmother&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a Mahony of Dunlow, Margaret ni Mahony; and my
grandmother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, merry Margery of Dunlow your great
grandmother!&rdquo; shouted Cuddy; &ldquo;St. Brandon help me!
the wicked wench, with that tempting bottle&mdash;why &rsquo;twas
only last night&mdash;a hundred years&mdash;your great
grandmother said you?&nbsp; Mercy on us, there has been a strange
torpor over me, I must have slept all this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Father Cuddy had done so, I think is sufficiently proved
by the changes which occurred during his nap.&nbsp; A
reformation, and a serious one it was for him, had taken
place.&nbsp; Eggs fried by the pretty Margery were no longer to
be had in Innisfallen, and, with heart as heavy as his footsteps,
the worthy man directed his course towards Dingle, where he
embarked in a vessel on the point of sailing for Malaga.&nbsp;
The rich wine of that place had of old impressed him with a high
respect for its monastic establishments, in one of which he
quietly wore out the remnant of his days.</p>
<p>The stone impressed with the mark of Father Cuddy&rsquo;s
knees may be seen to this day.&nbsp; Should <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>any
incredulous persons doubt my story, I request them to go to
Killarney, where Clough na Cuddy&mdash;so is the stone called,
remains in Lord Kenmare&rsquo;s park, an indubitable evidence of
the fact: and Spillane, the bugle man, will be able to point it
out to them, as he did to me.</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
